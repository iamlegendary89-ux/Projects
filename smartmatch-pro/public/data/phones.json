Low-light performance is excellent, and the phone's AI features, such as the magic editor for object removal and generative fill, are praised by reviewers like MKBHD. User feedback on Reddit is generally very positive about the camera quality, with many noticing an improvement in social media app photo quality.",

Benchmark scores from Geekbench 6 show a single-core score around 1586 and a multi-core score of approximately 4709, which, while no longer at the absolute peak compared to the latest 2025 flagship chips like the Snapdragon 8 Elite, still offers a very fluid and responsive experience. Long-term user reviews note that while the phone is still very fast, it can sometimes exhibit stuttering or throttling when it heats up during prolonged heavy tasks, an issue that wasn't as apparent at launch.

The camera produces shots with plenty of detail and good dynamic range. However, reviews consistently point out that the camera software tends to oversaturate colors, leading to vibrant but less natural-looking images compared to rivals like the Google Pixel. The 2x telephoto lens is effective for portraits but lacks the extended zoom capabilities of newer flagships that offer 3x or 5x optical zoom. In low light, the camera performs well, often capturing brighter images than competitors, though sometimes at the cost of realism. User feedback in 2025 indicates that while the camera was great at launch, particularly for portrait shots, it can feel slow to capture multiple shots in quick succession and some users find its quality less competitive against modern phones.",

The battery life is stellar, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use. Samsung's commitment to 7 years of software updates adds significant long-term value. However, it's not a revolutionary leap forward; charging speeds are unchanged and trail competitors, and the removal of Bluetooth from the S Pen is a step back.

This processor provides a significant performance boost over the previous generation, with a 37% increase in CPU performance and a 30% increase in GPU performance. In Geekbench 6 tests, the device scored around 3121 in single-core and 9937 in multi-core tests. While these scores are impressive and ensure extremely smooth multitasking and gaming, the phone faces stiff competition. For instance, the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a stronger single-core performance, though the S25 Ultra often leads in multi-core benchmarks. Compared to the latest flagships like the Google Pixel 10 Pro, the S25 Ultra maintains a raw performance edge due to the Snapdragon chip, even though the Pixel benefits from Google's software optimization.

The most significant hardware upgrade is the 50MP ultrawide, which reviewers praise for capturing dramatic shots with excellent detail and dynamic range, while also improving macro photography. The primary 200MP sensor continues to deliver exceptional photos, and the dual telephoto setup provides outstanding long-range zoom capabilities. Low-light performance is solid, showing improvement in noise reduction compared to the S24 Ultra, particularly with the new ultrawide sensor.

This places it among the longest-lasting flagship phones of 2025, competitive with the iPhone 17 Pro Max and surpassing many rivals. Charging speed, however, remains unchanged at 45W for wired charging. This allows the phone to charge to about 71-72% in 30 minutes, which is faster than an iPhone but lags behind other Android competitors that offer 65W or 100W charging.

For its price point, performance is generally considered adequate for everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and media consumption. However, the Exynos 1280 is a chipset from early 2022, and some users report occasional sluggishness and heating, particularly with more intensive tasks or gaming. Some games may require reduced graphics settings for smooth play. Compared to the standards of 2025 flagship phones, its performance is significantly lower. Geekbench 6 scores for the Exynos 1280 are around 968 for single-core and 2078 for multi-core, which is well below flagship-level processors that routinely score over 2000 and 7000, respectively.",
