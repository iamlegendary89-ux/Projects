    "onePageSummary": "The iPhone 17 Pro Max introduces a bold redesign with an aluminum unibody and prominent camera plateau, available in striking Cosmic Orange. It features a 6.9-inch LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED display with 3000 nits peak brightness and improved anti-reflective coating. Powered by the A19 Pro chip with vapor chamber cooling, it delivers top-tier performance (AnTuTu 2,600,583; GeekBench 10,118 multicore) and better sustained thermals, though some heat issues persist. The triple 48MP camera system includes a new 4x telephoto lens with 8x optical-quality zoom, praised for photo quality but slightly behind Android rivals in low-light. Video capabilities remain class-leading. Battery life sees meaningful gains (17:58h active use), though charging remains slower than competitors (40W wired). iOS 26's Liquid Glass UI refreshes the experience but has minor bugs. Apple Intelligence lags behind Google/Samsung in functionality. Durability is enhanced with Ceramic Shield 2, but aluminum is prone to scratches. Priced from $1,199, it offers strong longevity with Apple's update policy.",
