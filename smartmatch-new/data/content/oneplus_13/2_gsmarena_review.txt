Flagship phones are bigger than they have ever been and with every step up in size, they leave behind a group of people for whom the phone is now just too big to handle.It made sense to do this financially as a vast majority of people seem to prefer larger devices. However, with smartphone sizes being what they are now, it no longer makes sense for big to be the only option you offer. Other companies figured this out some time back and now it's OnePlus' turn.The OnePlus 13s is the company's first compact flagship smartphone. From everything the company told us, there was a concerted effort to ensure the phone lives up to the flagship title with minimal compromises, which hasn't always been the case with previous compact phones.OnePlus 13S 5G specs at a glance:Body: 150.8x71.7x8.2mm, 185g; Glass front, aluminum alloy frame; IP65 dust tight and water resistant (low pressure water jets).

Misc: Fingerprint reader (under display, optical); stereo speakers; Circle to Search.The OnePlus 13s is based on the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chip as the bigger OnePlus 13. The 5850mAh is almost as big (or even bigger if you consider the Chinese 13T) as the 6000mAh on the 13. There is one less camera on the back - and a very curious one at that - but we will get to that later. And finally, the iconic OnePlus Alert Slider has been done away with in favor of an iPhone-style button called the Plus Key, which also deserves its own section.As you can tell, there have been some compromises made along the way to achieve the smaller size. But does the phone still live up to the flagship title? Let's find out.UnboxingThe OnePlus 13s comes in standard OnePlus packaging adorned in the company's bright red color. Inside, you'll find the phone, a color-matched silicone case, an 80W charger, and the classic red cable.The case that comes with the phone is also fairly typical for OnePlus phones sold in the Indian market. It provides adequate protection for the phone and for most users should be the only case they'll probably ever need.--- PAGE 2 ---DesignLet's start with the OnePlus 13s' raison d'être, and that is its size. Right off the bat, we want to dispel any potential misunderstandings regarding how small this phone is. OnePlus markets the 13s as 'compact' instead of 'small', and there is a reason for that.The 13s isn't truly "small" by conventional standards. If you had something like the iPhone 12 mini or even the ASUS ZenFone 10 in your mind then you'll be sorely disappointed. Think more along the lines of the current standard-sized iPhones or the Galaxy S25 and you'll be closer to the actual size of the 13s. In fact, all three have essentially the same width but the 13s is a bit taller to accommodate its larger display.The 13s takes some inspiration from these devices for the overall silhouette of its design. We have seen OnePlus do the flat metal and glass slab design before as recently as on the 13R but the 13s goes a step further and introduces much larger radius corners that are closer to that of the Samsung and the iPhone. From the front with the screen off, you might be hard-pressed to tell the difference between these phones.The display uses flat glass, which thankfully has become the norm these days. OnePlus uses a larger than typical 6.32-inch display and the company achieves this by having relatively thin bezels. Unfortunately, the bezels do not have a uniform thickness, with the top and side measuring 1.34mm and the bottom bezel 1.845mm. You might think you wouldn't notice that difference, but you do.More noticeable was the corner radius of the display, which does not match the corner radius of the phone, so the corners have thicker bezels than the sides. And if you really want to be annoyed, check out how the SIM tray is a different shade of pink than the rest of the phone. This might seem trivial but it's the sort of thing you expect from something marketed as a flagship and attention to detail isn't really 13s' forte.The back of the phone has a sizable camera module at the top carved out of a single piece of aluminum. This houses the two camera lenses along with the IR blaster and the LED flash. The camera module sticks out a fair bit but it's also large enough on this relatively compact phone that it does not cause a lot of wobble when the phone is resting on its back. OnePlus claims that the placement of the module is optimized to stay out of your way when holding the phone sideways but it was impossible to not just touch the module but have your fingers rest directly on the camera glass in our use.The Panda glass panel used for the back of the phone uses a different finish based on the color you pick. The black variant has a metallic sand finish while the pink (first for a OnePlus device) and green (exclusive to India) have what OnePlus calls Velvet Glass with a soft texture. It's an interesting finish but sometimes it feels as if OnePlus goes through far too much effort to make its glass backs feel less like glass.Ergonomics is a big reason to consider a smaller phone over your typical flagship and here the OnePlus 13s does quite well. The size feels great in hand and the weight is well-balanced. The power button falls right where you place your thumb and the same is true for the Plus Key if you're left-handed.There are some caveats here. First, reaching the top of the screen for the notifications is still a bit of a stretch, even if it's nowhere near as bad as on a big phone. Second, the fingerprint sensor position all the way to the bottom of the screen is abysmal. And finally, at 185g, this is not a light phone and feels heftier than what its size would lead you to believe.In terms of subjective build quality, the OnePlus 13s feels great in hand with a premium finish and a sturdy feel. However, objectively speaking, the phone is worse than most flagships these days, as it only comes with an IP65 rating. It's the same as the cheaper OnePlus 13R and is adequate against splashes and rain but cannot protect the phone against submersion.--- PAGE 3 ---DisplayThe OnePlus 13s has a 6.32-inch AMOLED display with 2640 x 1216 resolution. It uses an LTPO panel with a 1-120Hz refresh rate. Peak brightness is rated at 1600 nits in HBM and 800 nits under normal conditions. The display also has 100% Display P3 coverage and 10-bit color depth.At an odd 19.54:9, the display on the OnePlus 13s is slightly shorter than the 19.8:9 panels that OnePlus typically likes to use. This causes the front camera to intrude a bit in typical 18:9 YouTube videos, which doesn't happen on the bigger OnePlus 13 or 13R.In our usage, the OnePlus 13s display exhibited great all-round performance in terms of color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles. HDR performance is also excellent thanks to the inclusion of Dolby Vision and HDR10+.The display is covered by a flat piece of Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, the same as the one found on the 13R. This is a cheaper alternative to the flagship Victus glass used on more premium devices and should expectedly have worse durability. The same glass is also used for the camera module on the back.The display uses an optical fingerprint sensor, unlike the ultrasonic unit found on the 13. It worked well enough during our testing but won't be as reliable if your hands or the display are wet and will occasionally blind you in the dark with its light.Battery and chargingThe OnePlus 13s has a single-cell 5850mAh Li-ion battery. This is notably smaller than the much more impressive 6260mAh SiC battery on the 13T despite the two phones having the same exterior dimensions and weight.OnePlus informed us that the battery on the 13s was made smaller to accommodate a better front-facing camera. Unlike the fixed-focus 16MP unit on the 13T, the 13s has a 32MP auto-focus unit. This is the first OnePlus phone to have auto-focus on the front camera, which the company told us was a much-requested feature and worth the concessions made to the battery.However, we are not sure if we buy this answer from OnePlus, as comparing the inner scans of both devices reveals that 13T and 13s have visually identical motherboard sizes and layouts. There is no visual evidence that the battery is physically smaller to accommodate a bigger camera and the two phones even weigh the same. Not to mention, it makes no practical or logistical sense to re-engineer the entire motherboard design and battery around a single component like the front-facing camera.This suggests that the choice to go with Li-ion on the 13s is likely due to other reasons, such as wanting to hit a lower price target for the Indian market. The front camera may not be at fault at all.Of course, this assumption is based on the accuracy of the OnePlus' own visuals. Perhaps someone enterprising enough would one day rip open both devices and put them side by side to confirm or disprove this theory.The 13s has impressive charging speeds, courtesy of its 80W charger. You can hit 75% in 30 minutes from flat and 100% in 51 minutes, although a true full charge takes about an hour. The charging was oddly slower than the 13R, which has a slightly larger battery and the same 80W charging.Charging speed

25W PDThe phone also offers a bypass charging feature, which can only be enabled while gaming through the gaming overlay. This feature bypasses the battery and powers the phone directly, which prevents heat accumulation due to charging and keeps the temperatures low.Finally, there is no wireless charging support on this phone. It's not clear if the company ran out of budget or space but the result is very unflagship-like.SpeakersThe OnePlus 13s has stereo speakers in the usual places at the top and bottom. The phone only includes Oppo's OReality audio processing as OnePlus has stopped including Dolby Atmos on its phones with the 13 series, a regrettable decision considering the 'flagship' status of these phones. This means you cannot get native Atmos audio in apps that offer this feature, such as Apple Music.In terms of audio quality, the speakers on the OnePlus 13s do not impress. There have clearly been compromises made to the volume allocated to the speakers internally, resulting in a somewhat tinny sound. The speakers still get loud but lack the body and richness of other flagship devices in the segment. The iPhones have notably resounding audio but also make compromises elsewhere in the internals.--- PAGE 4 ---OxygenOSThe OnePlus 13s runs on OxygenOS 15 running on Android 15. The company has promised four years of Android updates and six years of security updates.The phone comes with some new software features but we will get into those later. It's important to address the experience of using OxygenOS, which unfortunately has deteriorated over the years, undoing many of the improvements it has had.Many factors contribute to this. For starters, it's the amount of pre-installed apps. At a time when many vendors are being vocal about the reduction or a complete lack of bloatware and pre-installed apps on their phones, OnePlus has only doubled down on increasing it.OxygenOS 15There is an oppressive insistence from OnePlus on having its own version of every app, which results in two web browsers, two photo galleries, two file managers, two app stores, and even two contacts apps. It seems the company is incapable of picking one from each of these and worse, won't let you do it either since none of these can be uninstalled.Pre-installed appsOxygenOS is also genuinely awful in the way it wastes your time with inane notifications. Every few days you will be asked to manually optimize the battery usage for one of the apps you have on your phone. Phones from other companies manage this automatically on your behalf and even though OxygenOS is set to manage this automatically, it will still bother you to tinker with the background usage settings for one of the apps for absolutely no reason. This is just one of the many kinds of system notifications the phone will keep popping up throughout the day and of course, you do not have permission to disable these notifications.The OS is also incredibly aggressive in the way it shuts down apps in the background. There is no coming back later to an app you had opened previously as it would have guaranteed to be closed by then. It is often a struggle to run our testing apps that require background processing as the phone would just quit them without warning even if there is no shortage of memory.Features and customizationThese annoyances often get in the way of enjoying the things that are actually good. OxygenOS has robust multitasking capabilities inherited from tablets and foldables, which makes it surprisingly functional, even on a smaller screen. There is extensive customizability on offer. The built-in apps, while sometimes superfluous, all function well. Little touches such as an app used to share a file opening in its own floating window instead of taking up the entire screen are appreciated. And finally, the phone was perfectly stable in our use with no bugs to report.MultitaskingClearly, there is a lot to appreciate here. But it's buried underneath much more in-your-face annoyances that taint the overall experience. OnePlus needs to take a page from competitors like Nothing in minimizing distractions and annoyances while maintaining functionality, otherwise the software will remain a sore spot for the company.Plus KeyDebuting on the OnePlus 13s is what the company calls the Plus Key. This officially ends the eleven-year run the Alert Slider had as the best physical switch on any Android phone. But just as the Alert Slider was based on the iPhone's Ring/Silent switch, the Plus Key is based on the iPhone's Action button. And this time it's not even subtle.The menu for the Plus Key can be found in the Settings app. Open the menu and you get a UI very similar to that of the iPhone's but with somehow fewer options and only one of them can be set at a time. And that's really our problem with this button.The Alert Slider might have had the same idea as the iPhone but it went a step further and added a third notch for DND instead of just toggling the ringer. The Plus Key, meanwhile, is satisfied being a cheap knock-off of the iPhone's Action button with even fewer options to choose from.Plus Key functionsOne would expect the Android implementation to have added perhaps single, double, or even triple-tap gestures along with added functions so you can do more with the same button. However, it is content doing the same lackluster singular press-and-hold function as on the iPhone, which feels like a massive waste of potential.OnePlus AIAlong with the Plus Key, the OnePlus 13s is also the launchpad for OnePlus's AI endeavors, unimaginatively titled OnePlus AI.This includes a bunch of new features but the main one is AI Plus Mind. Assigned by default to the Plus Key but can also be brought up with a three-finger swipe up, it captures a screenshot and uses AI to analyze the contents within. It can parse information such as phone numbers, addresses, dates, etc., and file them along with the image. You can easily click on these details later to add them to your calendar, and contacts, or open them in Maps. It can also summarize the text within the image and later this year you will also be able to automatically categorize saved content.Mind SpaceOther AI features include AI Voicescribe for recording, summarizing, and translating calls in popular messaging, video, and online meeting apps, an AI Call Assistant with the new OnePlus Dialler app (currently exclusive to India) that can also do real-time call translation and call summarise on regular phone calls, an AI Search feature for contents on the device, AI Reframe for adjusting photo compositions, and coming later this year, AI Best Face 2.0, which can automatically correct facial expressions. There's also a new AI Translation app, which other than doing basic translations, can also be run on top of other apps so it can continuously translate the text on screen or the audio currently playing.OnePlus has also announced improved integration with Google Gemini, which will now work in OnePlus apps like OnePlus Notes, Clock, and more.OnePlus's AI features so far seem limited but also relevant to what users might actually need. Most of these features do have valid use cases and we got decent use out of the AI Plus Mind feature to quickly file away information as it's like a screenshots utility on steroids. It would serve the company well to stick with such usable features on its AI journey instead of trying to be everything for everyone.PerformanceThe OnePlus 13s is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, which is ultimately the source of OnePlus' flagship claims. Paired with the chip is 12GB of LPDDR5X memory and a choice of either 256GB or 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.OnePlus has also employed a 4,400mm² vapor chamber to keep the chip cool. While larger than that of most phones of this size, it's also less than half the size of the 9,925mm² vapor chamber used by the OnePlus 13 which has the same chip. To prevent some of that excess heat from pooling in one spot, the OnePlus 13s also has a graphite sheet underneath the back glass that spreads it around and prevents hotspots.As usual, there are two aspects to the phone's performance, what we see in practice and what we can measure with benchmarks. In benchmarks, the OnePlus 13s routinely fell short of the OnePlus 13. The smaller heatsink design prevents the chip from running at higher clock speeds outside of short bursts so any extended benchmark will result in a lower overall score.GeekBench 6

1272 x 2800 pxAnd just to confirm that the limitations were cooling-related and not due to underclocking, the OnePlus 13s produced the same benchmark scores as the OnePlus 13 once we cooled it down below ambient. This shows the OnePlus 13s isn't running a gimped version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite but rather just has to clock down more aggressively once the smaller heatsink reaches its limit.This does not have much bearing on real-world performance, which was always excellent. The OnePlus 13s also handled Indian summers well, keeping display brightness up even when shooting all day under a 40°C sun. The phone also offered excellent gaming performance, although the maximum 120Hz refresh rate was reserved for only a handful of whitelisted titles, such as BGMI. Everything else just ran at 60fps.Getting back to thermal performance, the OnePlus 13s did well in our tests specifically designed to highlight cooling performance. However, one has to keep in mind you are also getting proportionately less performance compared to other Snapdragon 8 Elite devices so while the phone never gets uncomfortably hot, it's also not running full throttle. Having said that, this chip has so much performance to offer that even if you lose some of it under extensive use, there's still a lot available.Thermal throttling--- PAGE 5 ---Camera hardwareThe OnePlus 13s has an unconventional and somewhat controversial camera system on the back. The phone makes do with a dual camera system that includes a standard wide and a 2x telephoto but with no ultra-wide capabilities.The OnePlus 13s shares its rear cameras with the OnePlus 13R. Both phones have a 50MP f1.8 main camera and a 50MP f2.0 2x telephoto camera. Like the 13R, the 13s has OIS for the main camera but only EIS for the telephoto camera. Crucially, the 13s lacks the ultra-wide found on the 13R.This is certainly an odd state of affairs. Not since the Pixel 4 have we seen a manufacturer boldly eschew an ultra-wide on the back of the phone in favor of a telephoto, as the typical configuration for a dual camera system is wide+ultra-wide, not wide+telephoto.This makes sense, as you can emulate a 2x or even higher crop factor from a sufficiently high-resolution main camera. However, there is no way to emulate an ultra-wide perspective from a standard wide lens without employing third-party lens attachments or using some sort of AI trickery. So for all practical purposes, the only way you are getting an ultra-wide perspective out of a OnePlus 13s is by simply walking further away from your subject.When asked about this choice, OnePlus informed us that most people prefer to use the telephoto camera on their phones over the ultra-wide. A quick poll within our office and also on social media confirmed this; an overwhelming number of people voted in favor of the telephoto if they had to choose between it and an ultra-wide for their second camera. And it seems OnePlus was forced to choose as space was at a premium inside the phone.But most people seemed to have more than 2x telephoto on their minds if they had to choose a telephoto over an ultra-wide, and this is where the OnePlus 13s comes short. It feels like you are not getting enough zooming capabilities when you bartered that ultra-wide in favor of that 2x telephoto. A 2x barely qualifies for a supposed flagship and you feel further shortchanged when you realize you aren't even getting OIS on it.Without an ultra-wide or a dedicated lens, the OnePlus 13s has limited macro capabilities. The phone switches to macro mode on the main camera when you get close enough to the subject but only if you have a 2x or higher zoom level selected. This is because the main camera cannot focus on subjects closer than about 8cm from the lens and needs digital zoom to sufficiently magnify the subject. The telephoto also has no macro capabilities.In a bid to makeup, the front camera on the OnePlus 13s is more than what one has usually come to expect from OnePlus. The 13s has a 32MP front camera that is the first to feature auto-focus for a OnePlus device. This is one of the few changes over the 13T, which has a 16MP fixed-focus front camera. The camera on the 13s can also do 4K 30fps video whereas the 13T unit can only do 1080p.Camera appThe OnePlus 13s is not a Hasselblad-branded phone so the camera software experience is closer to the 13R than the 13. However, the overall experience and feature set are close enough that it's not a big loss.Camera appThe camera app on the OnePlus 13s is one of the better ones around, with a well-laid-out interface and adequate, relevant features. It has the options you need and gets out of your way while shooting, and that's just how we like it to be.Image qualityLet's start with the main camera on the OnePlus 13s, which we are reasonably familiar with now. Image processing is similar to that of the 13R, with good detail and vibrant colors with punchy contrast, occasionally at the cost of shadow detail. However, while this did seem to be the default behavior, there were times when the images looked oddly flat and low-contrast in comparison.1x main samplesThe telephoto camera matches the main camera to a T, often down to the inconsistent processing of the colors. Images from this camera are slightly softer without the slight oversharpening of the main camera but the level of detail is just as good.2x telephoto samplesThe camera app has a handy 4x toggle, which makes taking a leap from the 2x easier without having to manually drag the zoom dial. We had our doubts about this mode but it turned out there was no need for them as the 2x sensor seems to have enough latitude to get perfectly usable or even good 4x images.4x telephoto samplesThe macro results weren't as impressive. Macro images tend to invite close-up examination and the main camera cannot keep up in terms of detail when digitally zoomed in even at 2x, let alone further. You can get decent results at times but this isn't macro photography by any stretch of the imagination and you can get these results from any phone by digitally zooming in a bit.Macro samplesFinally, there is the front camera. This camera produces decent image quality but suffers from OnePlus' tendency to capture full-resolution images from front cameras that were clearly not designed for it. This 32MP sensor looks like it was meant to produce 8MP binned images as the default 32MP image is clearly very soft. Resize the image down to 8MP and you get tack-sharp results more in line with what the camera was meant to produce.Selfie samplesThe autofocus results in perfect focus on faces but is more helpful in videos when you're trying to show something on camera. You can hold it closer to the lens and get sharp focus on it as long as you make sure you cover your face as the focus priority will always be on faces.Video qualityThe OnePlus 13s produces excellent quality videos from its main and telephoto cameras, in both 30fps and 60fps frame rates. You get ample detail and good colors, and the optional Dolby Vision HDR makes the videos absolutely pop off the screen, much like ProXDR does for the photos.The only exception to this is the front camera videos, which neither offer HDR nor 60fps.--- PAGE 6 ---ConclusionThe OnePlus 13s is a neat little package. It is compact and easy to handle with a pleasing design. The display is great and the cameras, at least the ones that are present, perform well. The Snapdragon 8 Elite still packs a punch and the large battery will make it last longer than any other phone in this size category.But while the OnePlus 13s is a lot of things, it isn't a flagship. Like an ill-conceived RPG build, the OnePlus 13s blows all its points on two stats while ignoring the rest. The phone appears to be built almost entirely around the concept of a big chip and big battery in a compact body, and many compromises had to be made along the way to achieve that. The build quality, cameras, speakers, and charging all suffer as a result, along with a few baffling omissions, including an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and USB 3.So, the claims of being a flagship don't quite hold up, but it's easy to look past that, as at INR 55,999, it's also not priced like one. It's not as feature-complete as something like the Galaxy S25 or the Pixel 9 Pro but it's also a heck of a lot cheaper than either of those. If you have flagship aspirations but don't have the budget for it, the OnePlus 13s might just get you most of the way there without breaking the bank. A phone that's easy on the pocket, both literally and figuratively.Pricing
