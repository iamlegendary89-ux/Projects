Introduction

The most compact Galaxy is back! It brings the largest performance jump in years, but it will also go down in history as the tiniest update so far! That is because the Galaxy S25 update list has only one entry - the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.

The Galaxy S25 series has dropped the chipset fragmentation this year and every device gets the good stuff. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is the most powerful chip on Android to date, and this one is a special enhanced version for Galaxy. It allows for massive performance gains and also supports new connectivity options such as Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4.

Other than the heart of the Galaxy, the rest is the same as on the S24. The Galaxy S25 is an IP68-rated phone with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 panels and an aluminum frame. It has a 6.2-inch 1080p Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen with a small punch hole.

All cameras on the S25 are the same as they were on the S24 - a 12MP AF selfie and a trio of rear cams - a 50MP OIS primary, a 10MP 3x OIS telephoto and a 12MP FF ultrawide.

The charging capabilities remain identical, too. There is a 4,000mAh battery with support for 25W wired, 15W wireless and up to 4.5W reverse wireless charging. There is an update here that can easily go unnoticed - the wireless charging capabilities have been expanded to be Qi2.1 Ready.

Android 15 and One UI 7, with the power of the new Snapdragon chip, brings many software improvements and AI features, highly advertised by Samsung. Most of those, if not all, will make it to the older generation, too.

At least Samsung introduced some new colorways for the Galaxy S25, which is probably the only way to tell the S25 from the S24. Unfortunately, the Black color has become a Samsung.com exclusive, so if you hoped to get a dark color from your carrier or favorite retailers, Navy (dark blue) or Silver Shadow (gray) are your best mainstream options.

The Galaxy S25 is a wonderful compact phone even it its only upgrade is performance. If you are not coming from a Galaxy S24, but an older phone or a different maker, you will find it a great all-rounder. We did hope for an ultrawide camera upgrade, though, and we were disappointed to find out Samsung has brought exactly zero updates in the camera hardware.

Unboxing the Galaxy S25

The Galaxy S25 arrives in a thin black box and its only companion is a USB-C cable rated at max 3A.

The Galaxy S25 supports up to 25W fast charging, so you do not need to shop for another cable, only for a compatible USB-PD adapter if you don't already own one at home.

Design, build quality, handling

The Galaxy S25 trio this year has identical designs - flat frames with rounded corners and flat glass panels. Which is something we hoped to see in the Ultra model and we were happy to get. But from a Galaxy S25 or S25+ standpoint, there is nothing new across the exterior except for a 0.4mm reduction in thickness and the new paintjobs.

The Galaxy S25 trio

The Galaxy S25 uses Gorilla Glass Victus 2 panels and second-generation Armor Aluminum frame. The lesser S25 models are not getting the anti-reflective Gorilla Armor glass for a second year in a row, while the S25 Ultra is already using Gen 2.

Both the frame and the back panel feature a matte finish, while the whole phone is fingerprint-resistant (to an extent).

The Galaxy S25 trio

As we mentioned, the Galaxy S25 is some 0.4mm thinner than the S24, and it weighs 5 grams less. It's a compact phone that's very easy to forget it's in your jeans pocket.

This year, the Galaxy S25 is available in Icy Blue, Mint, Navy (ours) and Silver Shadow colorways - all muted colors, quite similar to the Z Flip6 models except for yellow. Samsung.com exclusive colors are Pink Gold, Coral Red, and Blue Black.

Mint, Icyblue, Silver Shadow, Navy • Pink Gold, Coral Red, Blue Black

The Galaxy S25 is IP68-rated for dust and water resistance. There are no further enhancements beyond what the rating suggests (1.5m-deep water immersion for 30 mins).

The 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED is at the front with impressively thin and even bezels. It uses a 1080p panel with up to 120Hz refresh rate. There is a small perforation to make way for the 12MP selfie camera.

The Galaxy S25 also comes with an under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, a premium piece of hardware that does not need illumination to scan your tips. And while it works pretty much flawlessly, it gets finicky if you use a glass screen protector.

There is a super thin earpiece outlet above the screen, almost invisible to the naked eye. It also doubles as a stereo speaker.

The other, larger speaker is at the bottom of the phone, together with the USB-C port, the mouthpiece and the dual-SIM tray (EU model).

The Galaxy S25 supports two nano-SIMs and two eSIMs, and you can use a maximum of two SIM cards, no matter their type. The American version accepts only one physical SIM card (plus two eSIMs).

Galaxy S25

Another microphone, or maybe a pair of microphones, sits at the top of the Galaxy S25.

One of our favorite design traits across the Galaxy phones is the camera housing, the lack of it to be specific. All three cameras on the S25 are surrounded by metal rings with no shared big black blots or similar monstrosities. The three standalone rings are unintrusive (even if they are really glued on top like the S25 Ultra's) and make for a seamless and simplistic design, timeless if you will.

The Galaxy S25 is a well-built smartphone with a likable design and the right shape for a secure grip. The S25 fits incredibly well in your hand and pocket, it is easily operated with just one hand, and it provides great experience whether it's being used for day-to-day operations, gaming or multimedia.

Display

The Galaxy S25 has an identical display to the Galaxy S24 - a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with 1,080 x 2,300 pixels, up to 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+ support.

The screen has a small punch hole and is shielded with a Gorilla Glass Victus 2 sheet.

According to Samsung, the maximum peak brightness is also unchanged since last year - 2,600 nits.

Well, our display measurements unfortunately confirmed that there are no surprises, and nothing has changed since the Galaxy S24.

The maximum brightness when controlling it manually was 438 nits without boost and 747 nits with the extra brightness boost. This is slightly lower than the Galaxy S24 and S23 screens.

The maximum automatic brightness we captured on the Galaxy S25 was 1,395 nits, about the same as on the Galaxy S24 and higher than the Galaxy S23.

The minimum brightness at point white was 1 nit, which is great.

The Galaxy S25 offers two refresh rate modes - Adaptive and Standard. Do not let these descriptions fool you, as, in fact, both modes are adaptive and will continuously switch refresh rates, but only the Adaptive one maxes out at 120Hz, while Standard is limited to 60Hz.

The Adaptive mode is, well, more adaptive by trying to better match Hz to the fps of the currently playing videos, while Standard will fix the refresh rate at either 30Hz or 60Hz for most videos.

The screen drops to the minimum of 1Hz for static content, no matter the mode. And it will work at 120Hz in compatible games.

Finally, the small Galaxy S25 supports HDR10 and HDR10+ - no Dolby Vision video here, as usual. YouTube served us HDR streams and so did Netflix, in FullHD too, thanks to the Widevine L1 compliance.

The Galaxy S25 also supports the Android Ultra HDR standard and will boost highlights for metadata-enhanced photos taken on it, or on other standard-abiding handsets. It works in the in-house Gallery, as well as Google Photos and Chrome.

Battery life

The Samsung Galaxy S25 draws power from the same 4,000 mAh battery as last year and uses the same 6.2-inch OLED display. The only change from a hardware perspective is the chipset, now supposedly with a more efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. And, of course, One UI 7.0 software, which is also touted as more efficient too.

Update, 10 Feb 2024: Following further retesting, the game result has been adjusted to a higher figure after the review publishing. We've updated the Active Use score below to reflect the new results.

Battery life as we measure it hasn't changed much from the Galaxy S24. Samsung has been oddly consistent with its numbers. The video playback runtime remains pretty solid and so does the call runtime. The web browsing/social network browsing score leaves more to be desired. And there is a notable improvement is the game runtime, which is something we saw in our S25 Ultra and S25+ reviews, meaning it's probably courtesy of the move to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.

Charging speed

There's no change in the charging protocol coming from the Galaxy S24, or the S23, or the S22 for that matter. You get a maximum of 25W using a compatible Power Delivery 3.0 charger with PPS.

The wireless charging is still 15W, but Samsung updated it to be Qi 2.1 ready, which means you get support for magnetic wireless charging accessories, but there are no magnets inside the phone (hence the Ready part) so to use the feature you need a case that has magnets built-in.

Compared to other smartphones on the market that are not Pixels and iPhones, the Galaxy S25 is extremely slow to charge, taking well over 1 hour to top up the battery.

On the plus side, slower charging may be easier on the battery longevity in the long run. Additionally, Samsung offers a few Battery Protection options if you feel that extra care is needed. You can choose between Basic (stops at 100% and starts again after a 5% drop); Adaptive (adjusts by your charging and sleep patterns); or Maximum (you can choose a custom limit 80%/85%/90%/95%).

Speakers

The Galaxy S24 features a hybrid stereo speaker setup, with one speaker positioned at the bottom and the earpiece serving as the second. In typical fashion for hybrid pairs, the earpiece outputs quieter sound emphasizing high and mid-range frequencies, while the bottom speaker delivers rich bass along with clear vocals.

According to our tests, the S25's speakers are a bit quieter than the S24, now achieving a Good -26.1 LUFS loudness score.

We were also able to distinguish some changes in how the Galaxy S25 speakers sound now compared to the S24. We like this year's tuning better, as Samsung brought out more bass. As a result, music tracks sound deeper and fuller than before, but without muffling the mids and highs. Vocals are still very prominent, but the overall sound is richer.

Use the Playback controls to listen to the phone sample recordings (best use headphones). We measure the average loudness of the speakers in LUFS. A lower absolute value means a louder sound. A look at the frequency response chart will tell you how far off the ideal "0db" flat line is the reproduction of the bass, treble, and mid frequencies. You can add more phones to compare how they differ. The scores and ratings are not comparable with our older loudspeaker test. Learn more about how we test here.

Android 15 plus One UI 7

The Galaxy S25 boots Android 15 with One UI 7. Samsung promises seven years of software support that includes both major Android updates and security patches.

Here's our One UI 7 review in mobile view format - watch it on your phone:

One UI 7 looks a lot like One UI 6 with its signature icons, widgets and wallpapers. The operational logic hasn't changed much - you still rely on your homescreens, app drawer, gestures or button navigation, and the drop-down area.

Android 15 and One UI 7

One UI 7 has split the notification and quick toggles into two separate panes, like on the iPhones. Now you drop the notification page from the top left corner of the screen, and the expanded quick toggles page from the right corner of the screen. That said, you still get the option to revert to a common interface showing both your quick settings and notifications.

Samsung provides a few custom apps like Gallery, My Files, Internet, Health, Calculator, Calendar, Wallet, the powerful Notes app, and its own Bixby assistant.

The entire Google suite is also pre-installed, plus a few Microsoft apps - Office, OneDrive, Outlook, LinkedIn.

Google Gemini is at the heart of AI, as usual. You can ask Gemini a lot of stuff to do, even make entire conversations with the Live feature.

Gemini

Perhaps the most significant new addition is system-wide support for natural language input, enabling features like AI Agents, AI Summary, Gallery control and Cross-app Actions.

AI Summarize is a cool feature - the AI can analyze the screen's content in more detail and offers a short summary of the page.

AI Summary

Google recently updated Circle to search, so now it analyzes not just the screen contents as an image but can also listen to the audio that's currently playing and ID the music track.

Circle to Search

The natural language input allows you to control your phone in various ways. For instance, you can voice search your Gallery and ask the AI assistant to pull out photos from your trip to a particular place.

You can even go to Settings and ask it to enlarge the font if it's too small, although this is limited to system menus only.

The Cross-app Action is arguably the most exciting feature. You can ask the AI to fetch information online and store it in Notes or create a Calendar event with the info. Or even send it as a message to one of your contacts. And you can do all of that with a single prompt.

This is quite impressive as the system is now capable of more complex tasks involving changing system settings and interacting with multiple apps, and all of that works with natural language input.

For now, the feature is available only with Samsung's and Google apps, but Samsung promises to introduce support for third-party apps, including WhatsApp and Spotify.

The Gallery Generative Edit is quite powerful - it can add or remove people and objects, with their shadows, of course. It also allows you to sketch some things and add them to your photo.

Generative Edits in Gallery

Some personalized AI features are also at hand, such as Now Brief and Now Bar. Now Brief offers a summary of your daily schedule - for example, in the morning, it will summarize your last night's sleep, give you a quick brief look at your daily appointments and even let you know whether your favorite podcasters or artists have released new content. It will also come up at noon and in the evening to help you stay on top of things.

Now Brief

The Now Bar has a similar concept, except that it lives on your lockscreen and focuses on current apps and events. It will provide contextual information like what song you are playing, turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps with a suggested departure time so you are not late for your meeting, and even keep up to date with live score updates on your favorite sports team.

Now Bar

Samsung's DeX functionality is still part of One UI 7. You can connect a monitor, wired or wirelessly, to your Galaxy, and expand its Android capabilities in a desktop-like interface with windows and everything. The PC support for DeX is gone now, and Samsung suggests the Galaxy users should use the updated Link to Windows app by Microsoft instead. The app offers the same features as the PC DeX, for seamless PC-to-phone and vice versa transfers.

The Galaxy S25 software feels new and refreshing in a tangible way. However, most of that comes thanks to the visual overhaul that One UI 7 brings and this one is bound to trickle down to the Galaxy S24 as well. The all-important animation snappiness and fluidity are at a level above the others, and the interface looks very good.

There are subtle new UI sounds that give the software a physical presence. Samsung took its time with this release and it shows. We're still kind of sour that the vertically scrolling app drawer didn't happen. At this point, only Samsung phones lack the feature.

Performance and benchmarks

The Galaxy S25 is powered by the 3nm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the most powerful SoC any Android phone can enjoy right now. It's a "Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy", meaning the two prime CPU cores are clocked higher (4.47 GHz vs. 4.32 GHz), and the Adreno GPU runs at higher clock speeds.

The Elite chip uses Oryon processor cores, two versions of them - two Prime cores and six Performance cores. These aren't Cortex cores like in MediaTek and Samsung Exynos chipsets, but a custom Qualcomm design. The two Prime cores run at up to 4.47GHz, while the Performance cores are clocked at 3.53GHz.

Then there's the Adreno 830, which is built on a new architecture using a sliced design with dedicated memory for each slice. The 830 has three of these slices clocked at up to 1.2GHz.

The Galaxy S25 is available in 128GB (UFS 3.1), 256GB (as reviewed) and 512GB (UFS 4.0) storage tiers, while the RAM is the same across all three - 12GB LPDDR5X.

The Galaxy S25 scores chart-topping results across the board. The Elite processor is the fastest Android CPU to date, scoring at least 30% higher than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and between 20% and 30% more than the Dimensity 9300 and Dimensity 9400 CPUs.

The Adreno 830 inside the Snapdragon 8 Elite is also the best-scoring GPU on Android right now. It is 30% more powerful than the Adreno 750 inside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and about 10% better than the Immortalis-G925 inside the Dimensity 9400 chip.

The AI performance of the Elite chip is currently unmatched as well.

The Galaxy S25 and its boosted Snapdragon 8 Elite demonstrate excellent performance capabilities by delivering chart-topping results in our CPU and GPU tests, even though the Antutu result isn't exactly exciting.

The sustained performance is similar to the previous generation of Galaxies - there is 57% CPU performance loss and 46% GPU performance drop. The phone gets warm under continuous stress testing, but never hot.

The Galaxy S25 may have the best Android chipset, but the sustained performance isn't ideal - the situation is similar to a few other flagships, but it seems to be a little worse here.

Familiar triple-camera setup on the back

The Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25+ both feature the same camera system as their predecessors ever since the Galaxy S22 lineup. We've got the familiar 50MP main camera joined by a 10MP telephoto camera and a 12MP ultrawide one. The selfie unit is 12MP with autofocus.

Wide (main): 50MP Samsung ISOCELL (S5K)GN3, 1/1.56", 1.0µm, f/1.8, 24mm, dual pixel AF, OIS; 4320p@30fps, 2160p@60fps
Telephoto: 10MP Samsung ISOCELL (S5K)3K1, 1/3.94", 1.0µm, f/2.4, 67mm, AF, OIS; 2160p@60fps
Ultrawide: 12MP Sony IMX564, 1/2.55", 1.4µm, f/2.2, 13mm, fixed focus; 2160p@60fps
Front camera: 12MP Samsung S5K3LU, 1/3.2", 1.12µm, f/2.2, 26mm, PDAF; 2160p@60fps

Having said that, we don't expect any drastic changes to the overall processing or quality, even with the evolution of ISPs throughout the years. Kudos for sticking with a potent 12MP selfie camera with autofocus, but we still think that the absence of autofocus for the ultrawide camera is far from ideal, to say the least.

Samsung has revamped the camera app with OneUI 7. The mode carousel is now placed under the shutter button instead of above and when you open the extra modes, they no longer hide your viewfinder. Pro mode options have been redesigned to keep the controls out of the way too.

Daylight photo quality

Main camera

The main camera produces clean stills with a good amount of detail, wide dynamic range and punchy, yet not over-the-top colors. The image quality is just like last year.

This also means the photos leave a bit more to be desired in terms of sharpness. They are not very optically sharp and when you shoot inside, they get even softer. We may have praised these photos 2-3 years ago but the industry is moving at a rapid pace.

Contrast is generally good, but sometimes photos can look a bit flat with more challenging lighting conditions, say when you have a backlit scene.

Main camera samples

You can force the main camera to capture in its full 50MP resolution, and the results are interesting. Sure, they are flat and look even softer without the extra processing (look at that mushy grass), but some parts of the image look better (the tiles on the facades).

50MP main camera samples

There are portrait toggles at 1x, 2x and 3x zoom levels, so there is plenty of versatility to play around with.

The Portrait mode shots are quite alright in terms of subject separation and bokeh rendition; however, the definition of the facial features is softer than in the regular photos. The difference is especially prominent with the 3x camera.

Portraits: Normal • Portrait mode

2x crop zoom

The 2x crop zoom photos are more than decent. Sure, you get a bit more grain and stills are generally softer than their 1x counterparts, but Samsung achieved lossless-like quality.

2x crop zoom photos

We observed some focus issues in 2x crop zoom mode, but they were rather minor. Take a look at the first scene in particular.

2x portraits: Normal • Portrait mode

3x telephoto camera

The 3x telephoto photos are fairly decent but definitely not a standout feature of the phone. The zoom photos match the main camera's processing in terms of colors, contrast, color temperature, etc.

Detail is solid, perhaps better than you'd expect, given the 10MP to 12MP upscale action. The grain is there in the shadows if you go looking for it, but it's not getting in the way. Dynamic range and colors are great.

3x camera portraits: Normal • Portrait mode

Ultrawide camera

We had high hopes for the ultrawide on the Galaxy S25 because the S24's ultra-wide was actually quite good (the lack of AF aside). However, compared to the S25+ we have for review as well, we were disappointed to see our S25's UW was plagued by some sort of a lens issue (a proper retail unit, mind you). As a result, faraway subjects like the buildings have compromised sharpness. Closer subjects appear to be unaffected as far as we can tell.

We've added a few Galaxy S25+ samples below so you can compare them for yourselves.

Still, the dynamic range is on point, and the overall processing seems to match the main camera's.

Selfies

There's no change in the selfie camera as well, which is a good thing because we liked the selfies by the S24 and we appreciate the autofocus. The subject is always well-exposed, with natural skin tone, excellent colors, wide dynamic range and plenty of detail to go around.

Selfies

Low-light photo quality

Main camera

Just like the vast majority of phones nowadays, the Galaxy S25's default Photo mode will decide for you when the dedicated Night mode is appropriate, given the scene. However, as last year, we found it to be very relaxed. In most cases, the system will prefer the standard Photo mode unless it's very dark.

The regular nighttime photos have a laidback processing and good highlight retention but not very bright shadows. There is plenty of noise too. The color rendition is nice.

Auto Night mode main camera samples

Forcing the Night mode produces much more likable results by clearing up the noise and boosting sharpness and contrast. In certain scenes, you can get dramatically improved results with the Night mode Forced On, so we suggest using it despite the aggressive microcontrast increase.

Forced Night mode main camera samples

2x crop zoom

With the 2x photos, rendition is largely comparable to that of the standard 1x, but expect a slight drop in sharpness and a further increase in noise. Opting for the dedicated Night mode is once again advisable as it boosts colors, clears up the noise and adds micro-contrast.

Auto Night mode 2x crop zoom samples

Interestingly, the camera would often refuse to take 2x Night mode shots even when trying to force it.

Forced Night mode 2x crop zoom samples

3x telephoto camera

The 3x telephoto camera seems to be struggling at night, no matter the mode. The samples are very noisy, with washed-out colors and definitely not the sharpest ones around. The Night mode brings out a bit more detail, fixes the color saturation and brightens up the shadows, but the end result is still far from ideal.

Auto Night mode 3x telephoto samples

We observed the same behavior with the 3x zoom camera where the camera just won't take Night mode stills sometimes.

Forced Night mode 3x telephoto samples

Ultrawide camera

Due to the misaligned focus we already mentioned, the ultrawide camera's low-light photos are a letdown regardless of whether we use the Auto mode or we force the Night mode on.

Again, we've added a few Galaxy S25+ samples below so you can compare them for yourselves. The difference is much more pronounced at night for some reason.

Ultrawide samples: Auto Night mode • Night mode

Video recording

All four cameras on the Galaxy S25 can record video at up to 4K60, with the rear main camera also capable of 8K30 recording. The Pro video mode adds 24fps options for both 4K and 8K. There is no 4K120 option like on the S25 Ultra.

The HDR video recording has been upgraded to 10-bit HDR video (up from 8-bit last year). There is also a new Galaxy Log video mode where you intend to do the color grading of the footage later yourself.

The default video codec is h.265 (HEVC), offering you the choice between prioritizing high quality or reducing file size. Alternatively, you can select the older, less efficient h.264 codec.

Every camera mode includes video stabilization, which you can disable in settings if you prefer another method for maintaining stability and prioritizing field of view.

Another video-related feature in OneUI is the new AI audio eraser in the Gallery, which allows you to adjust the volume of certain type of sounds in your videos after they’ve been taken - you get a choice of speech, music, wind, nature, crowd and noise.

You can check out the playlist below, which includes multiple video samples.

Starting with the 4K clip from the main camera. The footage is clean, sharp, and detailed, with a wide dynamic range, good contrast and punchy colors. It holds up to the flagship standard with ease. The 2x crop zoom video is quite decent too.

The 3x zoom video is very detailed, decently sharp and with a wide dynamic range. We also like the color reproduction and the clean look without noticeable noise.

The ultrawide camera produces very soft videos, especially for 4K due to the same misalignment issue. Again, we've added a Galaxy S25+ ultrawide sample in the playlist above so you can see how much sharper it is - especially at night.

When it comes to the nighttime performance, the main camera can record nice low-light videos, although we've seen slightly sharper clips from competing phones and with wider dynamic range. Notice the clipped highlights. On the other hand, there's plenty of detail in the shadows and the noise isn't too much.

We are surprised by the 3x telephoto camera as well. Sure, it's a bit grainy, but the level of detail and sharpness are both quite impressive for a small telephoto unit like this one.

The ultrawide video, on the other hand, is just abysmal. It's extremely soft, murky, with clipped highlights and lacks detail.

We tested the stabilization with the main camera in 4K mode and are extremely happy with the result. The stabilization is very smooth and probably one of the best around.

Competition

With yet another modest upgrade of this year's Galaxy S25 and the ever-evolving competition, it's becoming increasingly hard to recommend a Galaxy outright. On the other hand, only a handful of small-sized flagship solutions are out there, so the competition for the Gaalxy S25 in particular isn't as fierce.

Still, for around €800-900/$800-900, you can get an iPhone 16, Google Pixel 9 Pro and if you are willing to spend a little more, you can also snatch a Galaxy S25+ or a Xiaomi 15. The S25+ is obviously a very close alternative, so you will pay more for a slightly bigger display, faster charging and a few other small extra features here and there.

Apple iPhone 16 • Google Pixel 9 Pro • Samsung Galaxy S25+

The Galaxy S24 will also give you about the same user experience at a lower price. Especially when considering the fact that Samsung is offering long software support and the vanilla S24 will remain relevant for years to come. The lower 8GB RAM might affect AI performance negatively if that's something you care about. Also make sure you get the 256GB version at least as it has faster storage.

Xiaomi 15 • Samsung Galaxy S24

In any case, if you are looking for the best camera-centric phone without sacrificing portability, the Xiaomi 15 and the Pixel 9 Pro are probably your best bets. Both devices offer considerably better camera performance than the S25. Even the iPhone 16 delivers somewhat better stills, even though it doesn't have a dedicated telephoto unit.

You might be more satisfied with the competitors' battery life too. Although marginal in some cases, pretty much all of the Galaxy S25's direct rivals offer better endurance. In this context, the iPhone 16 is the undisputed champion, while the Xiaomi 15 beats all in the fast-charging race.

Verdict

The Galaxy S25 seems like a well-rounded compact device, probably one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, too, but it fails to impress with meaningful upgrades this year, and it's been running on the same camera hardware for a few generations now. Most of all, we are grumpy for not seeing some of the features of S25+ trickle down. There's no bump in the charging speed, no UWB support, it comes with 128GB storage by default, and battery life isn't exactly on par with the competition. Sure, the new AI smarts are nice, but the big upgrade in the software department doesn't make up for the lack of hardware innovation.

On the other hand, the Galaxy S25 is a solid all-rounder. It doesn't stand out, but it's somehow "good enough", especially if you are looking for a compact Samsung flagship. That's pretty much your only choice. You can rest assured that the display is excellent, performance is on point, the camera experience is just okay and battery life is dependable.

Still, if you aren't entirely sold on the Samsung ecosystem and you are just looking to replace your old compact Android phone, or iOS phone for that matter, there are better options for the asking price.
