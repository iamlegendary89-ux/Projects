Oppo Find X8 Ultra IntroOppo has just announced its latest top flagship, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra, and it's the perfect example of why looks can be deceiving. On the outside, it appears to be a fairly inconspicuous device with a friendly and elevated design that doesn't really try to capture your attention with any flashy features. Only the densely populated camera assembly at the back hints that something exceptional is going on here. On the inside, however, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Aside from the remarkable Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, the insane 16GB RAM and a very promising penta-camera, we also get a sizable 6,100mAh battery in a body that's below 9 mm in thickness and superfast 100W wired charging support. Superphone, indeed.So, how does Oppo's latest and greatest compare against some current Android rivals, like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, OnePlus 13, and probably the fiercest of them all, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra?

With a review score of 8.2, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra currently ranks as the best phone we've reviewed so far. It scores extremely well in performance, battery life, and camera image quality, significantly better than the price class average, but also fares extremely well in all other categories, like charging speeds, display quality, biometrics, and audio.

The Oppo Find X8 Ultra relies on a very understated, safe design language. Nothing too fancy or unique, just a flat aluminum design with a frosted glass back panel that is simple, but well-made. The phone's build is extremely solid and it feels very premium.Remarkably, the Oppo is fairly thin at just 8.78 mm, which is commendable given the amount of hardware you get inside. The company proudly claims this is the thinnest among camera phones with 1-inch type sensors, and it's about the same thickness as your iPhones and Galaxies (those are only a hair thinner).Previous Oppo and OnePlus phones all featured a three-way mute switch on the side, but with the Find X8 Ultra, we get a customizable Action Shortcut button, which is more or less identical to what you get with the iPhone 16 generation.Receive the latest mobile newsSubscribe

Another interesting hardware feature here is the side-positioned capacitive Camera Control Quick button, which is used to interact with the camera: a double-press opens it, clicking takes a picture or starts recording a video, while swiping up and down lets you zoom in and out. One difference with the Apple solution is that you can actually press down the iPhone's Camera Control button, while this is just a capacitive area that you tap on. Oppo already did something similar earlier with the Find X8 Pro, but this version has better finger movement recognition.

However, the most imposing design feature here is probably the large camera housing at the rear, which Oppo calls the Cosmos Ring. It's a very smart-looking camera island, but somewhat impedes the ergonomics of the phone as your fingers are always naturally forced beneath the Cosmos ring, and that hurts the overall grip. I had a similar complaint about the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and while Oppo's iteration is slightly slimmer, it's still a little annoying and worth mentioning.

The Oppo Find X8 Ultra is available in Matte Black, Pure White, and Shell Pink colors, which is a fairly decent and varied selection of hues. All color versions feature silky smooth matte finishes, so there's no major difference aside from the color itself. The phone is very well protected against the elements, boasting both the IP68 and IP69 water- and dust-resistance standards. While IP68 is now standard on flagships and is slowly trickling down towards mid-range and entry-level phones, IP69 is a bit more exclusive standard that protects the device from high-pressure water pulses from different angles.Recommended Stories

The Oppo Find X8 Ultra's display at the front is pretty standard as far as Android flagships come. It's a 6.8-inch AMOLED with LTPO technology allowing dynamic 1-120Hz refresh rate for the smoothest experience, with very high 1440 by 3168-pixel resolution, and a superb 1600-nit peak brightness. Oppo has also included 2160Hz PWM display dimming here, which ensures that your eyes won't get strained at lower brightness levels.According to our in-house display benchmarks, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra fares extremely well. It achieves a peak brightness of nearly 2,300 nits, which makes for great legibility, but is slightly lower than devices like the OnePlus 13, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and notably Xiaomi 15 Ultra, which beats everyone with a peak brightness of over 3,000 nits. The display is slightly colder than most other flagships in the default screen color mode, but you can manually make the screen warmer or colder, as well as enable D65 color temperature or outright switch to vivid mode. There's an adaptive tone setting, which functions a lot like Apple's True Tone and adjusts the colors based on the ambience. Display Measurements:

The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x:CIE31' and 'y:CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.These measurements are made using Portrait Displays' CalMAN calibration software.OPPO Find X8 UltraSamsung Galaxy S25 UltraXiaomi 15 UltraOnePlus 13The Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values.

And exploring the camera specs surely explains why the Oppo Find X8 Ultra performs so well in the camera department. There are five cameras at the rear, but one of those is a sensor, so you essentially get four actual cameras. As usual with Oppo, the cameras are tuned by Hasselblad, a long-time Oppo partner in the camera department. The main camera uses a massive 1-inch 50MP Sony LYT900 camera sensor, the same one that the Xiaomi 15 Ultra uses as well. The aperture here is slightly narrower at F1.8 versus F1.63 on the Xiaomi. The camera also notably uses an 8-element lens with high-refractive glass, which aims to minimize chromatic aberration. Thanks to in-sensor cropping, you also get lossless 2X optical zoom with the main camera as well. There are 3X and 6X zoom cameras here, but interestingly, the shorter one isn't a regular telephoto but a proper periscope. With a 70mm equivalent, it's best suited for portraits (Hasselblad portrait is supported here) and telemacro shooting thanks to its minimum focusing distance of just 10cm. This is the proper way to shoot macro photography: not with a low-res dedicated camera or by cropping the ultrawide, but with a high-quality periscope lens that lets you capture tight macro shots with extremely shallow depth-of-field.The longer periscope uses a Sony LYT-600 sensor and delivers a 6X optical zoom, or a 135mm equivalent. Thanks to Oppo's hybrid zoom algorithms, you can zoom to 120X on the Oppo Find X8 Ultra. The F2.0 ultrawide also uses a 50MP sensor, but it's a Samsung JN5 one and offers a standard 120-degree field-of-view, consistent with most other flagships.  Finally, the camera that's not really a camera, the True Chroma sensor! This one aims to correctly measure and adjust the color temperature across the scene, eliminating the possibility for white balance or skin tone inaccuracies. The True Chroma sensor segments the image in a grid and preserves the color temperature of each segment, ensuring true-to-life image reproduction.

Oppo's True Chroma camera promises an end to unnatural skin tones and hazy skies
Oppo Find X8 Ultra features the company's latest HyperTone Image Engine for computational photography, which takes care of the image-processing and color science of the camera. AI-assisted tone-mapping and improved dynamic range are also sorted by the HyperTone Image Engine. But probably the most useful feature here is the camera button, which lets you easily launch the camera from just about anywhere. It lets you quickly snap a photo or start recording a video in an emergency, which is super useful. Just like on the Oppo Find X8 Pro, you can't use the camera button to zoom in when the phone is in portrait mode, only when it's in landscape. A minor annoyance if we've seen one. Main Camera
The image quality with the main camera is superb. You get excellent dynamic range, with the phone having no problems capturing a superb picture in even the most extreme conditions. There's that natural detail with just the right amount of sharpness and pretty much no oversharpening present, making for some extremely true-to-life photos. In low-light conditions, the phone captures well-exposed photos, and we love the fact that it doesn't try to turn the night into day by overexposing them. Zoom Quality
The zoom quality with both the native 3X and 6X cameras gives us a very natural detail with no oversharpening. The dynamic range is good, but not exceptional here. While the Xiaomi 15 Ultra and the Galaxy S25 Ultra perform slightly better in the short zoom range, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra performs very well in the longer zoom range. However, the more you zoom past 10X, the more extreme the overprocessing becomes.Ultrawide
The ultrawide camera is decent, but scenes tend to get under-exposed and slightly colder than real life. Other than that, the ultrawide camera here is just as usable as on other flagship phones. Selfies
Selfies are superb here, with excellent sharpness, dynamic range, and colors that both pop out and stay true-to-life. Lovely!Video Quality
The Oppo Find X8 Ultra can take 4K60fps videos, and while the official press release mentions it's also capable of taking 4K120fps videos, our unit lacked the option.Another limitation of this phone is the weird lack of 24fps video recording, which is often considered cinematic and most other popular smartphone have that.Other than that, videos taken with this phone are splendid, especially when it comes to detail. There's superb sharpness even at 30X zoom! The dynamic range and the colors are also great. The selfie camera is decent, but the rear one definitely takes the cake when it comes to videos. Oppo Find X8 Ultra Performance & BenchmarksA powerhouse of the highest order

Unsurprisingly for a phone that carries the "Ultra" suffix in its name, the latest Oppo flagship comes along with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, one of the most powerful mobile chips at the moment. It's a 3nm chipset with eight cores, but it has a slightly lower max clock speed in comparison with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, which ticks inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra. That isn't noticeable in everyday life.There's also a RAM expansion feature, a signature for many Chinese phones, which allocates some internal storage to be used as memory. Here, you can expand the memory by up to 12GB, for a total of 28GB. Thanks to this, apps are kept preloaded in the background for longer, so you don't get as many app reloads.Our benchmarks are in, and they reveal that the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is comfortably sitting near the very top of the performance rankings, alongside many of if its direct rivals, and it's only the Samsung flagship that ekes out a win. CPU Performance Benchmarks:Geekbench 6SingleHigher is betterOPPO Find X8 Ultra3039Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra3137Xiaomi 15 Ultra2962OnePlus 132967Geekbench 6MultiHigher is betterOPPO Find X8 Ultra9346Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra9769Xiaomi 15 Ultra8965OnePlus 139081View allAccording to our in-house benchmark tests, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra does very well in the Geekbench 6 single-core test, performing on par with the OnePlus 13 and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but losing to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.In the Geekbench 6 multi-core test, the Oppo performs just as good as its rivals, with only the Galaxy S25 Ultra performing slightly better here. GPU Performance3DMark Extreme(High)Higher is betterOPPO Find X8 Ultra6528Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra6208Xiaomi 15 Ultra5826OnePlus 1363303DMarkExtreme(Low)Higher is betterOPPO Find X8 Ultra4225Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra2981Xiaomi 15 Ultra4771OnePlus 134452View allWhen it comes to graphics performance, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is exceptional. It beats all of its rivals in the 3DMark benchmark, where it achieves the top "high" result, which reflects the initial burst of performance. The "low" result, on the other hand, demonstrates how the phone performs when it has throttled a bit. Oppo Find X8 Ultra Software
The Oppo Find X8 Ultra comes with the company's ColorOS 15 software, which is based on Android 15. It's a fairly intuitive and customizable Android skin that's full of personalization options, and it comes with everything a modern 2025 phone should feature in terms of software. There's full support for Google services here.Now, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra isn't scheduled to arrive on the global market and will most certainly remain China-exclusive, which is the reason the interface is preloaded with many apps specific to the Chinese smartphone market. Even if you set the default language to English, you'd often be stopped in your tracks by prompts, alerts, and options worded in Mandarin. That's completely natural, and in stark contrast with the global version of the software which is pruned. In terms of AI, the phone has a lot to offer… but to Chinese users. For example, AI Search only works with Simplified Chinese, while AI Writer says it will only work in a handful of Chinese apps. Even the default AI assistant on board, Breeno, doesn't seem to speak an ounce of English. While you can install and use Gemini, there doesn't seem to be an option to invoke Google's assistant with the power button, or at least I didn't find such an option. Overall, it's a phone that's geared towards its domestic market, and that's perfectly fine. In terms of software support, we expect that Oppo will deliver five major Android updates and six years of security support to this one, which isn't bad at all. Oppo Find X8 Ultra BatteryWow!

Despite the thin and svelte design, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra hauls a massive 6,100mAh silicon-carbon battery on board. That's consistent with what its rivals like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra and OnePlus 13 offer, but way more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra with its small 5,000mAh battery has in store. We love the onslaught of silicon-carbon batteries, as they finally offer some much-needed movement in the top ranks when it comes to battery life.And indeed, the Oppo Find X8 Ultra performs admirably in our battery life tests, almost averaging nine hours, which is an excellent result! The phone fares particularly well in our custom web browsing test, which aims to replicate a regular web browsing experience with the screen set to 200 nits, achieving a result of nearly 24 hours. The Oppo Find X8 Ultra also beats its rivals in our custom video test. It also fares well in our 3D gaming test with a result of nearly 13 hours. Overall, great job, Oppo!PhoneArena Battery Test Results:

It's loud without distortion even at high volume, and the bass is surprisingly strong. The sound stage is fairly wide, and both mid and high frequencies sound very clear. The haptics are also great. Oppo has always put excellent haptic motors in its flagship phones, and the Find X8 Ultra isn't different. Haptics are accurate, strong, and precise, in the same ballpark as a Galaxy flagship or an iPhone. Should you buy it?

The Oppo Find X8 Ultra is a brilliant Android device that does many things right. It has a friendly and understated design language that shines with its simplicity, while also offering some unique hardware features that set it apart. Battery life is absolutely incredible — the phone just goes, and goes, and goes… The performance is snappy, too, and animations look buttery smooth. Typically for Oppo, the charging is exceptional too. Finally, the camera is feature-rich and delivers awesome image and video quality.Honestly, this is as close to that perfect phone you have in your mind as it gets, and it's hard to think what else can be improved. I only miss the antireflective coating from the Galaxy S25 Ultra feature, but no other phone has that unfortunately. And if I were to really pick the nits, the interface looks slightly dated and lacks the aesthetics of newer iterations like Samsung's One UI 7. Should you get this one? Unlike the Oppo Find X8 Pro that I reviewed several months ago, this one isn't really aimed at the global power-user, so you can only buy it in China. And while most people won't be able to buy it, this phone shows mainstream brands like Apple and Samsung that they can push harder with their Pro Max and Ultra models.
