    "summary_1_page": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 offers a refined compact flagship experience with the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB RAM across all models, delivering top-tier performance (GSMArena, NotebookCheck). Its 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display (2600 nits peak brightness, 120Hz LTPO) remains excellent but unchanged from the S24, with DXOMark awarding a display score of 157 (DXOMark, GSMArena). The camera system reuses hardware from the S22 era—50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x telephoto—resulting in capable but dated photography, particularly criticized for soft details and poor low-light telephoto performance (PhoneArena, TechRadar, NotebookCheck). Battery life averages 13-15 hours of active use with 25W wired charging considered slow versus competitors (GSMArena, Android Central). One UI 7 on Android 15 introduces AI enhancements like Now Brief and improved Gemini/Bixby integration, backed by 7 years of updates (Tom's Guide, Android Central). While praised for its lightweight titanium-aluminum design (162g) and IP68 rating, the S25's minimal hardware upgrades and high $799 starting price draw criticism for lacking innovation (NotebookCheck, PhoneArena).",
