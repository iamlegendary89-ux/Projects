    "summary_1_page": "The iPhone 15 Pro introduces a titanium frame, reducing weight by 19g while maintaining durability. All 9 sources highlight the A17 Pro chip's leading performance, with NotebookCheck noting sustained gaming capabilities despite some thermal throttling. The 48MP main camera receives universal acclaim, with DXOMark awarding 154 points, though low-light performance and ultrawide consistency are noted weaknesses. Battery life shows modest improvements (GSMArena 86h endurance), but 20W charging remains a consistent criticism. USB-C adoption is welcomed but limited to USB 2 speeds on the base model. iOS 17 brings new features like the Action Button, with Apple confirming 7 years of software support.",
