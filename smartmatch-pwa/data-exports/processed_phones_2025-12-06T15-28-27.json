      "summary": "The iPhone 17 Pro Max brings a bold redesign with an aluminum unibody and Cosmic Orange color option, replacing titanium for better thermal management via a vapor chamber cooling system. Its standout feature is the triple 48MP camera system, particularly the new telephoto lens offering optical-quality zoom up to 8x and superb video capabilities with Dolby Vision support. The display reaches 3000 nits brightness with improved anti-reflective coating, though color accuracy slightly trails rivals like the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Performance excels with the A19 Pro chip and sustained gains from enhanced cooling, though some reviewers noted overheating under heavy loads impacting battery efficiency. Battery life sees meaningful improvements (17h58m Active Use Score per GSMArena), while wired charging reaches 40W speeds requiring a separate adapter. iOS 26 introduces Liquid Glass UI with mixed reception due to transparency quirks and limited Apple Intelligence features compared to competitors.",
