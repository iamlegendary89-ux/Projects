Verdict on the Google Pixel 10 ProThe Google Pixel 10 Pro presents itself as a high-quality, compact flagship smartphone with Gorilla Glass Victus 2, an aluminum frame, and an IP68 certification. The features are comprehensive but not flawless. Although the smartphone adheres to current standards such as Bluetooth 6.0, UWB, NFC, Wi-Fi 7, and the new "Pixelsnap" magnet, the USB port remains limited for file systems and storage options are sometimes inconsistent — UFS 4.0 is missing even on more expensive models.The Pixel 10 Pro is particularly strong when it comes to software and AI functionality. Android 16 comes with seven years of updates, Gemini features, and live translations. However, the latter still seems immature and often delivers incorrect results.

The display impresses with its high brightness and good color reproduction, but suffers from PWM flickering, which does not offer any reprieve to sensitive users despite the 480 Hz option. In terms of performance, the Tensor G5 lags behind the competition. Everyday performance is smooth, but benchmarks and gaming tests show clear deficits. Gamers in particular have to live with falling frame rates and a lack of ray tracing.The camera delivers versatile and very good results overall, but it reaches its limits when it comes to details, dynamic range, and low-light quality. The AI works unreliably at times, particularly when zooming, especially with fonts or moving subjects. Nevertheless, it is certainly one of the best setups in a smartphone.

Build: Pixel 10 Pro comes in four colorsThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is available in Moonstone, Porcelain, Obsidian, and Jade (our test device). The smartphone is nominally 8.6 mm thick — we measured 8.25 mm — and with the camera hump it is 11.9 mm. Both the front and back are made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, while the frame is made of highly polished aluminum.The Pixel 10 Pro is very well made and only shows minimal irregularities in the gaps between the rear glass and the frame. It can withstand twisting attempts with a slight crunch. The Google smartphone is IP68-certified and therefore both dustproof and waterproof.

Features: Now with PixelsnapThe Pixel 10 Pro is available with 128, 256, 512 or 1,024 GB storage. microSD cards are not supported. However, not all storage variants are available in all colors. We also find the 128 GB version to be too small for a high-end smartphone.Bluetooth has been upgraded to version 6.0 by Google. Otherwise, the features are very similar to its predecessor: NFC, UWB, and an IR thermometer are once again on board.What is new, however, is Pixelsnap. This is similar to Apple's MagSafe and includes a set of magnets on the back that can be used to lock accessories and chargers in place. Incidentally, the Pixel 10 Pro worked perfectly with a MagSafe charging surface in the test.The USB port works according to the 3.2 standard (Gen. 1) and, in combination with a Samsung Portable SSD T7 allows decent transfer rates (221.57 MB/s). However, it only supports FAT32 and exFAT file systems — NTFS cannot even be read.Wired image output is also possible, but the screen can only be mirrored.Top: SIM tray, Microphone

Software: Seven years of updates for the Pixel 10 ProThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is delivered with Android 16 and will receive updates for the next seven years (from the first availability of the device in the Google Store in the USA).Highlights are the numerous AI functions such as Gemini, Gemini Nano, Gemini Live, Circle to Search, improved live translation, and image editing functions. Google's own free VPN is also included.
SustainabilityIn its sustainability report, Google provides a comprehensive overview of the Pixel 10 Pro and also presents specific figures on CO2e emissions and the proportion of recycled materials. The outer packaging is plastic-free.According to iFixit, experienced users can repair their Pixel 10 Pro themselves with instructions and spare parts for the smartphone. However, these are not yet available at the time of writing.Communication and GNSS: Wi-Fi 7 and dual-band GNSSThe mobile reception of the Google Pixel 10 Pro is good in urban environments and gives no cause for criticism. The frequency coverage is exemplary, so there should be no connection problems worldwide.Wi-Fi 7 is supported with three frequency bands. In combination with our Asus ROG Rapture GT-AXE11000 reference router, the Google smartphone achieves high and largely stable transfer rates.

outdoors
in the buildingThe Pixel 10 Pro uses dual-band GNSS for positioning, which supports all global satellite systems. The satfix takes a relatively long time indoors and is not particularly accurate. Outdoor reception, on the other hand, is quick and highly accurate.We compare the Google phone with the Garmin Venu 2 fitness smartwatch on a bike ride. The Pixel 10 Pro is slightly less accurate and is occasionally a bit off the path, but this should not be a limitation for navigation tasks.GNSS test drive: Circumnavigation of the lake

GNSS test drive: SummaryPhone functions and voice quality: Pixel 10 Pro with dual SIM
The voice quality of the Google Pixel 10 Pro is very good when held to the ear. Voices are conveyed naturally and clearly, provided the surroundings are not too loud. However, if this is indeed the case, the Pixel user's voice sounds muffled and can even be difficult to understand at times.VoLTE and Wi-Fi calls are on board, of course. The smartphone can use a nano-SIM. An eSIM is available as an alternative or in addition, but unfortunately dual physical SIMs are not supported.The Pixel smartphone can also translate the call live during the call. However, this must first be activated in the phone app settings. An online connection is not necessary for this, as the required 1.55 GB data must be downloaded to the phone in advance.Unfortunately, only a handful of languages are available so far and the translation is often bumpy or incorrect. Expletives are often ignored or simply turned into something positive. We liked the fact that the voice of the speaker is also used for the translation.Another new feature is the option to send audio emojis, which are then converted into acoustic noises.Cameras: Powerful triple shooters in the Pixel 10 ProSelfie with the Google Pixel 10 ProThere is a 42 MP lens with autofocus on the front that acts as the selfie camera. It uses pixel binning due to which finished images are around 10 MP in size, but they look good in low light. The selfie camera's quality is impressive and delivers well-balanced photos. Videos are recorded in 4K Ultra HD at a maximum of 60 fps, while those who want to use 10-bit HDR are limited to 30 fps.The main camera has three lenses, of which the main lens and the telephoto lens are equipped with optical image stabilization (OIS). The ultra-wide-angle lens also serves as a macro lens. The imaging performance is very good and the Pixel 10 Pro impresses with a balanced image composition with natural colors. However, there is sometimes a lack of detail and dynamism in the depth of the image, which makes a OnePlus 13 does better in the lake scene. In low light, the scenery has a successful light balance, but this is at the expense of some of the details, and the image also turns out quite bright.The situation is similar with the ultra-wide lens, which brings out the depths well but again at the expense of detail. There are also aberrations in the peripheral areas. When zooming, the Pixel 10 Pro delivers a strong performance and delivers good results even at 10x digital zoom. From 30x magnification onwards, the Pro Resolution Zoom is activated, which uses AI to analyze and improve the image, similar to what we've already seen with the Honor Magic7 Pro or the Magic V5. The results are quite good, as long as there are no living creatures in the image, in which case errors can quickly occur. The AI also has its problems with text. A maximum of 100x Pro Res digital zoom is possible.Another new feature is Camera Coach, which is designed to help you find inspiration for new photos and get the best out of your chosen motif with step-by-step instructions.Video can be recorded in a maximum of 8K 30 fps with Video Boost. 10-bit HDR is available with all lenses up to 4k 30 fps. In general, the user can choose between 24, 30 and 60 fps modes. It is easy to switch between the cameras when filming.

Accessories and Warranty: Pixel Care+ only in the USAAs expected, the Pixel 10 Pro comes with a small scope of delivery, which only includes a USB-C cable and a SIM ejector pin.The warranty offered in Germany is 24 months and cannot be extended. The Pixel Care+ insurance package is reserved for customers in the USA.Input devices and Operation: Ultrasonic fingerprint reader in the Pixel phoneThe capacitive touchscreen of the Google Pixel 10 Pro responds quickly and reliably to inputs. The gliding properties of the glass are very good. The display also features an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which has high recognition rates and unlocks the smartphone quickly and reliably.Unlocking via the front camera is available alternatively, which is less reliable, especially in low light.The linear vibration motor provides crisp haptic feedback and can be adjusted relatively extensively in the settings. The power button can be used to start Gemini by holding it down, and either the camera or the wallet can be opened by pressing it twice.
Display: Pixel 10 Pro offers a bright LTPO OLEDSubpixel structureWith its 6.3-inch OLED display, the Pixel 10 Pro is a compact smartphone. Nevertheless, it offers a high resolution and correspondingly sharp display.Thanks to LTPO technology, the refresh rate is dynamically adjusted by the system between 1 Hz and 120 Hz. The HDR standards are almost fully supported, but Dolby Vision is not included.The brightness of the Google smartphone is very high. Even without the ambient light sensor actively engaged, up to 1,405 cd/m² brightness is possible on a pure white surface.If the sensor is activated, the luminance increases to around the 2,200 cd/m² mark. With a reduced white surface (APL18), the luminosity can go all the way to up to 3,199 cd/m², and 3,207 cd/m² when playing an HDR video.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)ℹTo dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) . This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.Screen flickering / PWM detected 240 HzAmplitude: 17.24 %The display backlight flickers at 240 Hz (worst case, e.g., utilizing PWM) . The frequency of 240 Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.In comparison: 53 % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8224 (minimum: 5 - maximum: 343500) Hz was measured.

PWM at minimum brightness with 480 Hz function activated (amplitude: 14.56 %)Like most other smartphones with OLED displays, the Google Pixel 10 Pro is not spared from PWM flickering. As with the Pixel 9 Pro, this works at a relatively low 240 Hz (see above). Although the amplitude is very flat, sensitive users should still expect problems with prolonged use.The "Adjust brightness for sensitive eyes" option can be found in the Accessibility settings. This is supposed to double the PWM frequency to 480 Hz, which we measured.At minimum brightness, this still remains at a low 240 Hz and only increases to the promised 480 Hz when the display is already very bright. The function therefore offers no advantage, particularly in the evening and in darker environments.min.25%50%75%100%Measurement series with fixed zoom level, activated 480 Hz function, and different brightness settingsThe most natural color representation of the display is achieved when the Natural color profile is selected in the settings.This offers optimal Grayscale, ColorChecker, and Saturation Sweeps values.Grayscale (Mode: Natural, Target color space: sRGB)

Display Response TimesℹDisplay response times show how fast the screen is able to change from one color to the next. Slow response times can lead to afterimages and can cause moving objects to appear blurry (ghosting).

The Pixel 10 Pro leaves a very good impression outdoors. Even if the Gorilla Glass display is relatively reflective, the content remains easy to read even in bright sunlight.The viewing angle stability of the panel is also very good. There is no color inversion even at very flat viewing angles — only the brightness decreases visibly.Outdoor viewing
Viewing angle stabilityPerformance: Tensor G5 lags behind the competitionThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is powered by the in-house Tensor G5 and can draw on a comparatively generous 16 GB of RAM.The system performance is very good and gives no cause for criticism, but the benchmarks show that the performance falls significantly behind most competitors.

This year, Google continues to rely on UFS 3.1 storage, not only in the 128 GB version, but also in the 256 GB version tested here. The competition is much faster here, as they have been using UFS 4.0 or even UFS 4.1 for some time.

Games: Work up a sweat quicklyThe Google Pixel 10 Pro does not have a weak SoC, but it is certainly not for gamers. This starts with the fact that ray tracing is not supported and the frame rates, which we tested with GameBench are not what we would expect from a high-end smartphone.At best, the HDR setting can be selected in PUBG Mobile and even the lower HD setting is limited to just 40 fps. Even the lowest quality mode does not even work constantly at 60 fps.In demanding games like Genshin Impact, we can see that the frame rate drops over time and falls well below the targeted 60 fps. The smartphone also gets warm during gaming.PUBG Mobile

Notebookcheck's overall impressions of the Google Pixel 10 ProWith the Pixel 10 Pro, Google is offering a compact flagship smartphone with a good camera, plenty of stamina, and seven years of updates. However, we would have preferred more in terms of raw performance for the asking price.

Editor of the original article: Daniel Schmidt - Managing Editor Mobile - 723 articles published on Notebookcheck since 2013As a child I was fascinated by my Commodore 16, and this sparked my enthusiasm for computers. Using my first modem, I surfed the BTX videotext system and later the World Wide Web. I have always been captivated by the latest technologies, and this is especially true for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. I’ve been part of the Notebookcheck team since 2013 and have also on occasion written for Notebookinfo.de, and I’m looking forward to testing new innovations for our readers. I like to spend my spare time indulging in photography and barbecues and being with my family.contact me via:
