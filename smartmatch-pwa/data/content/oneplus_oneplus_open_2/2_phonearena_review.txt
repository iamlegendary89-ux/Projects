What we know so farUPDATE: Sad news for OnePlus Open fans around the world! It seems that we won't be seeing a new foldable, at least this year. The OnePlus Open 2 has been postponed (potentially canceled), and the news was shared by no other than OnePlus Open's product manager Vale G. in a forum post. Here's an excerpt:"At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year."This leaves us hanging, as the Oppo Find N5 (which was the base for the now postponed OnePlus Open 2) won't be available in the US. People could still order this model through different channels but it will cost time, money and additional effort. We don't know if there's going to be another OnePlus foldable globally, but one thing is certain. There will be no OnePlus One 2 in 2025.Old story continues below:OnePlus definitely struck gold with its first foldable, the OnePlus Open. It's no coincidence that the model won the "best foldable" category in our PhoneArena end-of-year awards. And even though it's been only a couple of months since the global launch, people are getting excited for the successor, the OnePlus Open 2.The leaks and rumors are piling up as we type this, and we have a pretty good idea already what the OnePlus Open 2 will look like. This next-gen foldable will be a rebranded global version of the Oppo Find N5 (pictured above), and the latter aims to be the thinnest foldable out there with a thickness of just 4mm when unfolded. We also have the first hands-on images showing how mind-bogglingly thin this thing is!The display is expected to grow to an 8-inch inner screen (up from 7.82 on the previous model), and the outer screen is expected to sport 6.4-inch diagonal (up from 6.31-inch on the original Open). The OnePlus Open 2 is expected to feature a triple-camera setup. Its primary 50MP sensor will have new tech onboard called Hasselblad Master Tone, accompanied by a 50MP ultrawide lens and a 50MP periscope telephoto system.According to the latest leaks, the OnePlus Open 2 will come equipped with the latest silicon from Qualcomm - the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which should please OnePlus fans - the chipset is proving to be a real powerhouse. We're also looking at 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. There are a lot of speculations about the battery, we expect a 6,000mAh total capacity but there are also more modest rumors talking about a 5,700mAh battery.Finally, the OnePlus Open 2 is expected sometime in July, 2025 with the price still pretty much unknown.Jump to section:OnePlus Open 2 release dateOnePlus Open 2 priceOnePlus Open 2 nameOnePlus Open 2 cameraOnePlus Open 2 storageOnePlus Open 2 designOnePlus Open 2 displayOnePlus Open 2 batteryOnePlus Open 2 features and softwareOnePlus Open 2 hardware and specsShould you wait for OnePlus Open 2?OnePlus Open 2 release dateThe latest announcement date we have is for the Oppo Find N5 and it points toward a release in late February.

The original OnePlus Open was unveiled on October 19, despite being teased and leaked months prior to that. Preorders started immediately, with widespread availability starting on October 29. The Oppo Find N5, which, as we already shared, will serve as a base for the OnePlus Open 2, is expected to debut in China in late February or early March, so we shouldn't expect the global announcement for the OnePlus Open 2 to come earlier than that, at least.A little consolation is the special edition of the OnePlus Open called Apex Edition that the company unveiled with some new colors and a faux-leather back. So, if you don't want to wait for the sequel, you can grab the original. Device familyAnnouncementMarket releaseOnePlus OpenOctober 19, 2023October 29, 2023OnePlus Open 2July, 2025*July, 2025* *rumored datesOnePlus Open 2 priceOnePlus did something really interesting with the first Open, regarding the pricing. The phone launched at $1,699, but there was a global incentive to save $200 if you handed out any old phone in any condition. This included dumb phones as well, so in reality, the OnePlus Open could be bought for $1,499 at launch.The price of the OnePlus Open 2 is still a huge mystery, which is not surprising. Given how foldables are populating the market, we expect the OnePlus Open 2 to at least match the price of its predecessor, if not aim for a lower price tag. All in all, a price around the $1,500 mark seems plausible.OnePlus Open 2 nameThere's no information suggesting that OnePlus would tinker with the naming scheme of the Open lineup. We expect the next foldable model of the company to follow in the footsteps of the predecessor, name-wise. So, the next OnePlus Open will most likely be named the OnePlus Open 2. We know it is not the most original way to do it, but it is what it is.OnePlus Open 2 cameraThe original OnePlus Open launched with a whopping five-camera system: a 48 MP main camera, 64 MP 3x telephoto, and 48 MP ultrawide on the back, plus a 32 MP inner selfie and a 20 MP cover selfie.These sensors were positioned under Hasselblad-branded lenses, and given the productive partnership between the two companies, we expect the OnePlus Open 2 to bear the Hasselblad branding on its camera system once again.As for the sensors and camera configuration, we have the first leaks that suggest a switch to Sony sensor for the OnePlus Open 2 camera system. OnePlus is already starting to incorporate Sony's new line of LYTIA sensors, built using Sony's brand-new dual-layer transistor-pixel design.The leak is once again coming from DigitalChatStation and says that the OnePlus Open 2 will use a large Sony sensor for the main 50MP camera, and that we will get a periscope telephoto camera, alongside the ultrawide snapper, for a total of three cameras on the back.The latest batch of leaks corroborates the above. The same Chinese leaker revealed some specs of the OnePlus Open 2 (Oppo Find N5), including the specs of the camera. The main 50MP sensor will use something called Hasselblad Master Tone and will be accompanied by another 50MP ultrawide camera, and a periscope telephoto system again using a 50MP sensor.OnePlus Open 2 storageThe era of the microSD card is over, so we have to rely on onboard storage now. The good news is that we have the necessary technology to have plenty of space. The OnePlus Open launched with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of onboard storage, which should be enough for most people.Given that the OnePlus Open 2 is slated for release in late 2024, we might get a 1TB version due to the natural evolution of the storage market and the more widespread adoption of 4K and 8K video formats next year.OnePlus Open 2 designOne of the main reasons the OnePlus Open scored so high in reviews and won so many awards lies in its design. The phone offered a completely usable cover screen and an almost creaseless design.We have quite a few leaks and rumors about the OnePlus Open 2 design, and they are very promising. It seems that the industry is engaging in a new type arms race, this time trying to produce the thinnest foldable in the world. And while this title is currently held by Honor with its Magic V3, OnePlus is allegedly aiming for a "record-breaking" thinness. The info comes from the renown leaker DigitalChatStation, and lists some additional specs (more in the hardware section). This record breaking thinness should be in the 9.x mm ballpark, according to Mr. Station. The Magic V3 is 9.3 mm when folded, so the OnePlus Open 2 should be aiming for 9.1 or 9.2. Exciting times!
We also have the first leaked render of the OnePlus Open 2, courtesy of SmartPrix, showing the front and back of the phone. Furthermore, the first hands-on images started to pop-up on Weibo, showing the OnePlus Open 2 (actually, it's Chinese twin brother, the Oppo Find N5) and it's mindboggling thickness. The numbers we're starting to hear is under 4mm when unfolded. Which is just insane!

Meanwhile, Evan Blass sent us an email with a detailed render of the Oppo Find N5, with color variants and everything corroborating previous leaks on the subject. We expect the Chinese version to launch sometime in February, with the global model, the OnePlus Open 2 launching simultaneously.OnePlus Open 2 displayWe have the first scoops about the OnePlus Open 2 display and they point toward an upgrade. The OnePlus Open 2 is rumored to sport an 8-inch inner display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a step up from the 7.82-inch screen on the current Open. Its outer display will reportedly measure 6.4 inches diagonally, slightly larger than the 6.31-inch one on the original.Given the OnePlus Open 2 is expected to be a rebranded Oppo Find N5, we're pretty sure the display specs above will hold true. OnePlus Open 2 batteryRegarding the battery of the OnePlus Open 2, there are some early rumors that point toward a big increase in battery size. Judging from the cells in the predecessor (4,805 mAh total capacity), we initially thought we should expect something similar, which is pretty decent for a foldable of this type, but a new leak from DigitalChatStation changes things a bit.According to the famous Chinese leaker, the Oppo Find N5 will feature a 6000mAh battery. Wait, did we say Oppo? Yeah, there's a chance this exact Oppo Find N5 to be rebranded and sold outside China as OnePlus Open 2. If we take a look back in time to the original launch of the OnePlus Open, it followed the release of the Oppo Find N3 and it was basically the same device. So, if the Oppo Find N5 is coming with this huge 6000mAh battery, there's a good chance it will carry over to the rebranded OnePlus Open 2 (if more strict regulations don't force OnePlus' hand to use a smaller battery). However, the latest leak on the subject points toward a slightly smaller battery. DigitalChatStation published some specs, and they include the two battery cells inside the OnePlus Open 2. According to the leaker, these will be 2460mAh + 3105mAh, resulting in total capacity of 5565mAh or a typical capacity of 5,700mAh. Which is not the hype 6,000mAh but also not far off, especially for a foldable.What could also happen is the potential adoption of a new type of battery with a silicon cathode. This might bump up the capacity a bit, and we've already seen some prototypes from Honor, yielding 20% more capacity for the same volume compared to conventional Li-Ion batteries.The wired fast charging could also receive an upgrade; the OnePlus Open supports 67W, and we can see the OnePlus Open 2 getting 80W or more.OnePlus Open 2 features and softwareWhen it comes to software, this is probably the area that could see quite an evolution, as foldables still haven't realized the full potential of the formfactor, in our opinion. We expect Open Canvas to evolve and the Taskbar functionality to mature and offer more useful ways to multitask on the OnePlus Open 2.Software-wise, the OnePlus Open 2 will most likely launch running OxygenOS 15 over Android 15, and the global version will probably rely on Gemini or ChatGPT for AI magic. The recently announced in China OnePlus 13 launched with ColorOS 15 (based on Android 15) and was announced with its own Chinese AI assistant, plus a bunch of AI features we know from other LLM systems, such as photo editing, writing aids, voice summaries, etc.OnePlus Open 2 hardware and specsWe don't expect any surprises when it comes to the OnePlus Open 2 hardware situation. The previous model came equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, so we expect the OnePlus Open 2 to feature the current top Qualcomm silicon, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. However, the leak that concerned the release date of the OnePlus Open 2 also has a hardware portion to it.According to Chuh Bhai (a fairly reliable tipster on X) the OnePlus Open 2 will launch with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 processor sometime in 2025. And given we're already well into the year 2025, and that Qualcomm announced its next-gen Snapdragon flagman silicon (hint, it's not called Gen 4, it's the Snapdragon 8 Elite), there's a good chance the OnePlus Open 2 will feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite.According to the sole information source at the moment (DigitalChatStation), the OnePlus Open 2 will come with a special version of that chipset called Snapdragon 8 Extreme Edition. We're not sure if it's a translation quirk or a different chipset altogether, so we'll have to wait and see. Worst case scenario, the OnePlus Open 2 will feature the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.There are also rumors about an alert slider, just like the one on other OnePlus phones.Should I wait for the OnePlus Open 2?You should wait for the OnePlus Open 2 if you don't like what the original OnePlus Open has to offer. Frankly, people who aren't very keen to get a foldable right now and prefer to wait out the market to mature even more should wait a bit and maybe get the OnePlus Open 2 in 2025. It's a long wait but it might be worth it.You should not wait for the OnePlus Open 2 if you want a foldable phone right now. The OnePlus Open 2 will probably launch toward the end of next year, so the wait is shaping out to be a long one. Just get the OnePlus Open and be done with it!
