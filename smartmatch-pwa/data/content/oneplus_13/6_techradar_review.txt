OnePlus 13: Two-minute reviewThe OnePlus 13 is extravagant and restrained. It’s a beautiful phone, sure, but OnePlus has made beautiful phones before. The OnePlus 13 is trustworthy. It’s durable, maybe the most durable phone I’ve tested that wasn’t made with military standards in mind. It’s also refined, with a look that is equally pretty and smart. It will also get four years of Android updates from OnePlus, which is longer than you’ll probably own this phone.I highly recommend the OnePlus 13, and my biggest concern is that people won’t know what the hell phone I’m talking about. OnePlus fans know the company very well; other folks… not so much.As I reviewed the OnePlus 13, I met more people than ever asking me what’s that gorgeous phone I’m using (sorry, embargo). I’d tell them it’s the new OnePlus, then I had to spell the name of the company because they’d never heard of it. OnePlus is a company you need to know about if you’re in the market for a premium phone.

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)OnePlus had a fascinating trajectory. It started as a flagship-killer-maker, which means it made phones that gave you some of the features found on the best Samsung and best Apple phones, at a lower price. You might get a great display and amazing performance but middling cameras and no wireless charging. You’d also pay hundreds less.That’s not true for the OnePlus 13. This phone is uncompromising in every way. It’s one of the first phones to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and this chipset delivers on Qualcomm’s lofty promises.The OnePlus 13 has the best display on any smartphone* (*according to DisplayMate). It has the biggest battery and the longest battery life; and even better, it charges much faster than any Samsung or Apple or Google phone.The OnePlus 13 has great cameras, too. It can match the best camera phones in many situations, offering just enough artistic flair to compete with the iPhone while giving you AI assistance to zoom like a Galaxy.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsMissing features that used to hold OnePlus back have become its biggest strengths on the OnePlus 13. My key complaint about OnePlus phones was the lack of IP68 certification. Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy phones have been water resistant for almost a decade, but OnePlus has never officially certified any of its flagship phones for IP68 durability. This year, the OnePlus 13 takes the plunge with unbeatable IP69 certification, and it’s been the most durable phone I’ve ever tested that doesn’t look like a brick made out of a Jeep.OnePlus phones also used to lack wireless charging, but today’s OnePlus 13 has so-called AirVOOC wireless charging at up to 50W. To compare, the Qi2 charging standard supports up to 15W, and that’s what you’ll get with iPhone and Galaxy devices. The OnePlus 13 charges faster wirelessly than the iPhone 16 Pro can charge with a USB-C cable.

That’s probably why your friends or your parents haven’t heard of OnePlus. Selling a phone through Verizon or Vodafone is an expensive proposition that requires testing, free samples, and marketing money. By skipping the carriers and selling direct (mostly), OnePlus says it keeps its prices lower.Unfortunately, that means a lot of people who would probably love the OnePlus 13 will never hear about it. It also means the OnePlus 13 is harder to afford. When you buy a new iPhone or Galaxy from your carrier, they give you a big discount if you agree to pay for it for the next three years. You don’t get the massive discount with a OnePlus phone, but you also don’t get the three-year obligation.It’s hard to find anything I don’t like about the OnePlus 13. I don’t wish it had any more AI features now, but the lack of AI might mean this phone gets left behind when the good stuff – agentic AI – finally arrives in a couple of years.If you’re remotely considering the OnePlus 13, just buy it, you’ll be happy. The battery life alone makes this an easy decision, and the performance, polished interface, and delightful touches throughout make this a phone that will keep you happy as long as you own it, which will be a long time, thanks to its improved durability. The hardest part might be choosing the color and the magnetic case to go with it.OnePlus 13 review: price and availability$899.99 / £899 for 12GB RAM, 256GB storage in black only$999 / £999 for 16GB RAM, 512GB storage and the good colors

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)If the OnePlus 13 seems a bit expensive for a sleeper hit, that’s because OnePlus is great at making phones, but not so good at pricing them. You can ignore the list prices (below), because OnePlus offers a perpetual discount on all of its best phones that usually keeps the price lower. In the US, for instance, there is a $100 discount on the upgraded 512GB/16GB model, as well as a guarantee of at least $100 no matter what phone you trade. That means the price is effectively $799.99.The OnePlus 13 is competing with the absolute top-tier flagship phones, but you can buy it for the price of the base model. The OnePlus 13 cameras, display, and battery life all compete handily against the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the phone can be purchased for the price of an iPhone 16 or Galaxy S24.The real problem for OnePlus is where and how you can purchase the OnePlus 13. You can buy it directly from OnePlus, or you can buy it from Best Buy, but only the blue or black models, and if you walk into a Best Buy you’ll only find the black. Amazon will have the OnePlus 13 in the near future, but it’s not available on Amazon yet.OnePlus offers payment plans in the US through third-party Affirm, but doesn’t seem to have similar plans in the UK, which means many people will have to pay up front for the OnePlus 13. That’s not how most of us buy phones, so if you’re used to paying a monthly installment through your mobile carrier, there will be some sticker shock with the OnePlus 13.

OnePlus 13 in every color: black, blue, and white (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)Hang in there, though, because having an unlocked phone that you own is a huge benefit. You can shop around for any cell phone plan on any carrier, and when it comes time to sell your phone, you’ll be able to sell it without having a lien from a carrier agreement.The OnePlus 13 is available in three colors at launch: Midnight Ocean (blue); Arctic Dawn (white); and Black Eclipse (black). My review sample was the blue color, which might be the best one, but the white is quite striking, with a bit of texture in the back that makes it stand out. Also, there’s black.Swipe to scroll horizontallyStorage / RAMUS PriceUK Price256GB / 12GB$899.99£899512GB / 16GB$999.99£999Value score: 4/5OnePlus 13 review: specs

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)Except for a couple of hardcore gaming phones, the OnePlus 13 is the first mainstream phone we’ve tested with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor inside. The chipset delivers on Qualcomm’s promises. It’s much faster than the previous generation, and it beats Apple’s latest A18 Pro-powered iPhone 16 Pro in many benchmark tests.The wins don’t stop there. OnePlus says the display is the best that DisplayMate has ever seen, and our tests show it beats competitors in color gamut, if not average brightness. The RAM and storage are significant, and more than enough to drive all of the phone’s AI features and more.The most impressive specs might be the 6,000mAh battery and the accompanying 80W charging. I’ve never seen a battery this big in a phone that wasn’t made for hardcore gaming. With the huge battery and Snapdragon 8 Elite, the OnePlus 13 is our new battery life champ, and it charges back to full faster than any Samsung or Apple phone, even with the larger cell inside.Swipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 Row 0 - Cell 1 Dimensions:162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5mmWeight:210gDisplay:6.82-inch LTPO OLED, 120Hz, Dolby Vision, HDR10+Resolution: 1440 x 3168High brightness: 1,600 nits (4,500 peakChipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteRAM: 12GB / 16GBStorage: 256GB / 512GBOS:Android 15Cameras:50 MP ƒ/1.6 main; 50MP ƒ/2.65 3X zoom; 50MP ƒ/2.05 ultra-wideSelfie Camera: 32MP ƒ/2.45Battery: 6,000 mAhCharging: 80W wired; 50W wirelessColors: Midnight Ocean (blue); Arctic Dawn (white); and Black Eclipse (black)OnePlus 13 review: designLovely vegan microfiber (aka plastic) on the dark blueExcellent cases with magnets that make MagSafe accessories work

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)I’ve long been a big fan of OnePlus phone designs, but I had a major complaint that kept me from recommending them more often: OnePlus phones weren’t durable. They were not certified to be water and dust resistant, unlike every major Samsung phone since the Galaxy S7. That all changes with the OnePlus 13, and it changes in a big way.For such a gorgeous phone, the OnePlus 13 is shockingly durable. Most phone makers test phones to IP68 requirements, which means they can be submerged in one meter of water for thirty minutes, and they won’t allow any dust particles inside. OnePlus turns that dial to 11 with, it claims, the first IP69 certified phone. Technically, IP69 just means IP68 plus more, and OnePlus gave this phone a lot more.I saw OnePlus reps drop the OnePlus 13 into a clothes washing machine and run it with a full load. I saw the phone placed into a dishwasher, where it sat for a full dish cycle, including the drying. This phone doesn’t just take a dunk. It takes a dunk, a spray, and a punch to the face.It can’t handle salt water, sadly, but that only leaves room for future improvement. But seriously, this might be the most durable phone you can buy that isn’t made for the military or deep sea drilling operations.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)OnePlus makes the best looking phones you can buy, and the OnePlus 13 continues the trend. While I miss the swirly green from the OnePlus 12, which seemed like a magical object I picked up on my journey through an elfen forest, the Midnight Ocean blue is so strikingly classy that it’s undeniably a good evolution for OnePlus.For accessories, I highly recommend buying the Aramid Fiber Magnetic case, which is not only incredibly functional, it also looks snazzy with that bright red ring around the camera bump. OnePlus is also offering the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 in a matching hue, a very nice touch.The OnePlus 13 feels fantastic when you hold it, especially in the blue color with its soft, inviting, ‘microfiber vegan’ finish that makes me wonder why I’d ever consider a cold, glass-backed phone like the iPhone or Galaxy. The circular camera bump seems purposeful and stylish, unlike the embarrassed portholes on the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra. Be proud of your cameras! Of course, you get the Hasselblad H stamp next to the ring, for the three people you meet who have heard of Hasselblad – they will be very impressed.OnePlus keeps the mute switch on the side of the phone, and it’s the most useful mute switch on any device thanks to intuitive haptic feedback that clearly tells you when the phone will make a ruckus or when it will keep quiet.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)I usually ignore phone cases in my review, but OnePlus has gone above and beyond with this year’s offerings. My review sample came with the aramid fiber case (DuPont’s Kevlar is an aramid fiber), which also has magnets built in that by design line up perfectly with every MagSafe charger and attachment. With the case on, I had no trouble charging my OnePlus 13 on my Anker 3-in-1 cube, or attaching my magnetic wallet to the back – the one that came with my iPhone 16 Pro case.

It’s an incredibly smart system that – sorry Apple – every phone maker should adopt. Let’s make magnet placement a standard across all phones. OnePlus told me that it kept magnets out of the phone itself to keep the price down, but its cases are gorgeous, and third-party options are already making an appearance.Design score: 5/5OnePlus 13 review: displayFantastic display is rated tops by DisplayMate, apparentlyGreat colors with a slick design that is curved on all four sides

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)OnePlus points to DisplayMate, which says the OnePlus 13 earned DisplayMate’s Highest Ever Display Performance Grade of A++. Who am I to argue? Our own testing in Future Labs showed a wider color gamut than the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, except when the Galaxy was boosting its color with Vivid mode turned on.OnePlus loves to flaunt its maximum brightness numbers, but you will never see the phone reach the 4,500 nits that OnePlus claims. In our tests, the display was not as bright as the iPhone or Galaxy using HDR mode. In my real-world time with the phone, I had no trouble seeing the display even in bright sunlight, and OnePlus handed me the phone after flying me to Miami, so it was plenty bright.

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The fingerprint reader under the display was a delight, the most responsive I think I’ve ever used. I don’t remember a missed attempt in my entire three-week review period, while my Galaxy phone fails to read my thumb print on the daily.I even like the subtle curve all around the edges of the display. It makes for a very appealing device to hold and swipe around. My fingers never caught on the edges, and it gives the phone a premium feel.Display score: 5/5OnePlus 13 review: softwareThe best-looking Android interface, with just the right featuresNot as much AI as a Pixel or iPhone, for better and for worse

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)At its best, the OnePlus Oxygen OS 15 interface is delightful. It’s colorful enough to be engaging and unique, without feeling cartoonish or distracting. The OnePlus shelf is a brilliant way to handle widgets, with great designs, and the system settings and notification menus are refined and restrained. Every other Android phone maker should be following OnePlus’s lead, because the OnePlus interface doesn’t go too far, like Samsung’s OneUI, or oversimplify, like Google’s vanilla Pixel Android.Sometimes, OnePlus gets a bit silly in its pursuit to take on Apple, but it's an earnest attempt to create the most thoughtful and appealing phone software you’ll use. There is a fake Dynamic Island on the OnePlus 13 that mimics the pill-shaped island on the latest Apple iPhone 16. Unlike the iPhone, the OnePlus Dynamic Island persists even when the phone is in landscape mode. The feature Apple created to hide the hole in its screen is now being copied to create a fake hole in the screen.

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)I appreciated the attempt, and OnePlus sees utility in having a tiny little window with animations for app activity, like your Uber Eats meal approaching or your Audible audiobook playing. All around the OnePlus 13 I found thoughtful touches and flourishes. It never went too far, and OnePlus even retains its controversial Zen Space, an app that will literally lock you out of your own phone, with no way to regain access, for a period that you specify. Zen indeed.On the other hand, not everything is perfect. OnePlus claimed that its phones could tap to share with the iPhone, which would be a huge win for an Android phone. In fact, your iPhone friends need to download special OnePlus software, then walk through a series of steps. It’s not as seamless as OnePlus made it sound, and I’d never subject my iPhone friends to this process when I can just email a photo or file instead.

You get a lot of Google AI features, including Google Gemini and Circle to Search, but Google isn’t handing over all of the AI magic to its Android partners. For instance, my Pixel 9 Pro will screen calls using an AI assistant, but the OnePlus 13 can’t do that.

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)OnePlus also loads its phones with just a bit more first-party bloat than I’d like. There’s a Clone Phone app and that Zen Space app, and those should just be Settings options. The OnePlus Community app should be an optional download. There are sadly two Photos apps, because one is actually Google Photos and the other is from OnePlus. And why is there a strange ‘Internet’ web browser from third-party developer HeyTap? Chrome works fine.Software score: 4/5OnePlus 13 review: camerasWonderful cameras for action photos and low-light shootingHeavy reliance on computational tools, but photos look great

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)The OnePlus 13 has three 50-megapixel cameras, but forget about the megapixels because megapixels don’t matter. What matters is the size of the sensor. The main sensor on the OnePlus 13 is the Sony LYT-808, the same sensor used on the OnePlus 12. The iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra each use slightly larger main sensors, but the difference is minimal: around 0.06-inches diagonally.The OnePlus 13 has excellent cameras, and it’s one of the best camera phones you can buy. The OnePlus approach to mobile photography is going to be more and more important in the near future. Instead of packing the phone with massive sensors, OnePlus is aggressively enhancing images with computational photography techniques, to mostly excellent effect.From the main sensor, I got photos that fell somewhere between the oversaturated, explosive colors I see from the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the staid, film-like softness of the iPhone 16 Pro. The OnePlus 13 takes photos that are stylish and realistic, without being dull.

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)In some ways, the OnePlus camera is truly remarkable, like with zoom shots and action photos. Though the OnePlus 13 gets a lot of help from AI to fix the 3x zoom long-distance pics, the result is much better than the competition. Zooming in on my kid on the football field, the iPhone left him grainy and blurred, while the Galaxy made him look cartoonish. The OnePlus 13 offered remarkable detail and sharpness without much blur, even on action shots taken in low light.Shooting fast-action scenes gave the OnePlus 13 even more advantage. OnePlus paid for me to take a Royal Caribbean cruise with other tech media (I know, I know) to preview the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R, and I got to photograph folks riding the simulated surfing wave. Under cloudy skies or even at night with disco lights, I got amazing shots that other phone cameras couldn’t approach.I still think that the iPhone 16 Pro offers a better look, and the photos from my iPhone look like real photo prints, which can be charming. The OnePlus 13 offers amazing dynamic range, but it suffers from the classic camera phone problem of balancing everything too evenly. Sometimes I don’t want to see so much detail, I want a little more mystery.Camera score: 4/5OnePlus 13 review: camera samplesImage 1 of 6(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)OnePlus 13 review: performanceThe fastest phone you can buy, if you need thatAndroid needs software to justify performance gains, besides AI

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)What do you do with the fastest phone in the world? That’s the question I’m left pondering after my time with the OnePlus 13, which scored higher in important benchmarks than any other phone we’ve tested in Future Labs. It beat the iPhone 16 Pro Max handily in multi-core processing performance and on most graphics tests. Against the Galaxy S24 Ultra, the OnePlus 13 was twice as fast on some tests.In the real world? Yes, it’s the fastest phone I’ve ever used. The interface is incredibly snappy, and OnePlus says its doing work behind the scenes to make sure that everything apps open and windows render faster on the OnePlus 13 than any other phone. Still, phones were already plenty fast, and I don’t know a single human who can perceive the difference between the fastest overall and the third, fourth, or tenth fastest phone.The problem is that Android software, especially, hasn’t caught up to the performance benefits. Sure, I can use Adobe Lightroom or Adobe Premiere to edit photos and videos, but the software doesn’t work the same as it does on a desktop computer. Even worse, Apple has far more desktop-class applications developed for its mobile platforms, likely because it took the lead with pro software like Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro. Where is the Final Cut for Android? What apps justify the need for so much power?

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)I suspect that all of the Snapdragon 8 Elite’s processing power will be used eventually by upcoming AI features. For now, the AI story is confusing. It seems that the OnePlus 13 is offloading most of its AI work to various cloud servers. It isn’t doing much machine learning computation on the phone itself, even though that’s supposed to be the whole point of the Snapdragon 8 Elite.Frankly, the Snapdragon will benefit Samsung more than OnePlus, because Samsung stuffs its phones full of software features like the DeX desktop environment, the Bixby assistant, and more robust edge panels and pop-up bonuses. You’ll find a useful, simpler edge panel on the OnePlus 13 by swiping in from the edge of the phone, but you won’t find a desktop computer hidden inside. I appreciate that OnePlus doesn’t overload its phones with features I’d hardly use.Performance score: 5/5OnePlus 13 review: batteryThe longest battery life of any phone we’ve testedAstonishing charging speeds, even charging wirelessly

(Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)Ahhh, here’s the answer to the Snapdragon question: How does the OnePlus 13 benefit from using the Snapdragon 8 Elite? It’s the battery life, which is the best I’ve ever experienced from a mobile phone. My OnePlus 13 lasted longer than a full day of use every day I used it, and I would often forget to charge it at night in my first week of testing because I simply wasn’t worried that it would run out of juice.In our lab testing, the OnePlus 13 lasted 15 minutes shy of 20 hours. The iPhone 16 Pro Max lasted just over 17 and a half hours, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra couldn’t last 17 hours in our testing. That’s the longest any phone has lasted, though it shouldn’t be a huge surprise because the phone to beat was the OnePlus 12R, a big battery powerhouse with an efficient Snapdragon inside.

In the aramid fiber case with the AirVOOC charger (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future)In my real-world use, honestly I’m not entirely sure because charging the OnePlus 13 is very fun. It charges so fast, it’s incredible. OnePlus also gave me the new AirVOOC wireless charging puck with a cooling fan built in, and it attaches magnetically to the back of the OnePlus 13 when it’s wearing a case. Even with the wireless charger, the OnePlus 13 charges faster than my iPhone or Galaxy. But connected to a special OnePlus red cable? Superhuman (phone) speeds.When I can charge my phone past 50% in the 15 minutes it takes me to shower, I barely worry about battery life. Or I can drop my phone onto the wireless charger and get a full charge in an hour while I catch up on work. The OnePlus 13 lasts longer than any other phone, sure, but it almost doesn’t need to last so long because, even with the huge battery, it charges faster than all the rest.In 15 minutes, the OnePlus 13 charges to 52% full. In the same time, my iPhone 16 Pro Max reached 29%, and my Galaxy S24 Ultra hit 39%. After charging for 30 minutes, the OnePlus was five minutes from being totally topped up, while the other phones weren’t even three-quarters charged.OnePlus even gives you a charger in the box, though it must, because no other charger will charge the OnePlus 13 that fast. You must use the special OnePlus charger. In the near future, OnePlus will be releasing an even more special charger than can charge the phone to the full 100W speed, instead of just 80W, though that big brick will cost a lot extra.Battery score: 5/5Should you buy the OnePlus 13?Swipe to scroll horizontallyOnePlus 13 score cardAttributesNotesRatingValueDon’t let sticker shock scare you away, OnePlus offers discounts and trade-in bonuses to help.

OnePlus had no say in any part of this review and did not ask for any consideration in return. I tested the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R during that period and for two weeks after, side-by-side against all of my best phones.I tested the phone by submerging it in water, spraying it with a hose, and generally abusing it with liquids then washing it in the sink.I had the OnePlus 13 for around three weeks before this review was published. I used it as my primary work phone that time, including Slack, Google Meet, Vampire Survivors, and Google’s office suite. I also used Google Gemini Advanced with my own personal subscription to the service.I used the OnePlus 13 primarily as a camera and video camera, but I also played a lot of games, listened to music, and used it for maps and navigation. I connected the OnePlus 13 to my car stereo via Bluetooth and Android Auto, and I connected to a variety of other headphones including the matching OnePlus Buds Pro 3, Sony Bluetooth headphones, Google Pixel Buds Pro, and more.I benchmarked the OnePlus 13 using a variety of benchmarking software available from the Google Play Store. The phone was also independently tested in Future Labs by our reviews testing team.Why you can trust TechRadar☑️ 100s of smartphones reviewed☑️ 15 years of product testing☑️ Over 16,000 products reviewed in total☑️ Nearly 200,000 hours testing techFirst reviewed January 2025
