Such is the case with the iPhone 15 Pro which only gets a moderate telephoto camera and not the longer reach of the Pro Max.But, really - does 3x vs 5x make a world of a difference? Particularly with iPhones, where Apple goes to great lengths to standardize the experience across one generation, but also from one generation going into the next? We reckon not, at least for the sake of this reviewer who opted for a Pro, instead of a Pro Max.The 15 Pro otherwise gets the same treatment as the 15 Pro Max in all the other key areas - like the titanium in the frame that makes it a lot lighter than last year's model. This is, in fact, perhaps even more of an important development on the smaller model, and it now makes it a more viable option for those looking for a pocketable Pro iPhone.Naturally, a chipset upgrade is also part of the generational changes and there the Pro is as Pro as the Pro Max, of course - the 3nm A17 Pro is standard equipment. Not quite so is the storage situation, where the regular Pro's 128GB base trim level isn't befitting the name - the Pro Max starts at 256GB and that's a lot more like it.iPhone 15 Pro (left) next to iPhone 15 Pro MaxCircling back to the cameras (because it's not all about the telephotos), the iPhone 15 Pro also gets the 24MP jpegs (or heifs, if that's your thing) and the two intermediate pretend-focal lengths - there's so much more parity in the imaging department than there are differences, after all.Apple also invented USB-C this year, perhaps nudged in the right direction by the EU, but why not out of their own accord? (Because probably not.) Not strictly a Pro feature this one, since the vanilla iPhone 15 and the 15 Plus also use the industry-standard connector, but a most welcome development either way.Then there's some more of the usual stuff, the usual good stuff. The Pro iPhones have some of the best displays in the business, and the one on the 15 Pro is no different - in the same compact 6.1-inch size Apple settled on in 2020 with the 12 generation. While we'd say that underdisplay fingerprint readers should be mature enough for Apple to finally add one into the mix, Face ID remains a solid option for authentication. The autofocusing selfie camera that's in that same vicinity has proven great in the past too.iPhone 15 Pro (left) next to iPhone 15 Pro MaxBattery life has been a strong suit of iPhones for a while and we're seeing little reason why that would change now.

The less important bits that are still included are a SIM ejection tool, an Apple sticker, and some documentation.The one bundled accessory that's of more practical significance is the new USB cable (C-C) which is now braided. That should help make it last longer than the plain Apple cables of yesteryear, though we're not sure the white fabric will be looking pristine a few weeks down the road. The cable is also USB 2.0 spec, so if you're after the fastest possible transfer speeds, you'd need to get a different one. On to the phone itself we go now.--- PAGE 2 ---Design, build quality, handlingiPhone. Forged in titanium. This year, Apple is replacing the stainless steel that pretty much no one else used as a structural material in their phones with titanium - an even less common material in the industry. That should mean lighter, tougher and more corrosion-resistant frames, though there are nuances to those properties.What's beyond debate, however, is that the 2023 Pro iPhones are lighter - the 15 Pro, in particular, is 19g lighter than the 14 Pro, and it's a change that you can easily feel. This opens up the small Pro to a crowd that, up until now, wouldn't have considered it simply because of its pocket heft.While the 15 Pro Max is lighter than the 14 Pro Max by about as much, you always expect the Max to be big and heavy. Not quite so with the 14 Pro - its weight did use to come as a bit of a surprise for its size, and that disconnect is no longer there with the 15 Pro. In that sense, the new build is more fundamental to how the 15 Pro is perceived in the hand than it is to the Max.There's more to this titanium situation than meets the eye, however. While the material has been used on the outside, on the inside, it's aluminum that's replacing what used to be stainless steel. Doubtless, that's where part of the weight savings have come from, but the flip side of that substitution is that maybe the new Pros are less sturdy than the old Pros.While early YouTube 'testing' painted a grim picture of the longevity of the new Pro iPhones, we can't really speak to it ourselves. What we do know is that the iPhone 15 Pro is once again IP68-rated, exceeding the standard's requirements (1.5m for 30 min) - Apple's handsets are tested to survive for as long as 30 minutes down to 6m deep underwater. The Ceramic Sheild, the toughest smartphone glass, is here to stay as well.The back panel has no changes - it is as matte as before, made by Corning, and still not a Ceramic Shield one. You'll see the iPhone 15 Pro on this page in Black Titanium and White Titanium, and Blue Titanium and Natural Titanium are also available. Those appear to be quite dull colors, obviously an effect Apple wanted as those are all metallic inspired, but still likable.For what it's worth, the Black model we tried seemed to collect fingerprints and smudges much more readily than the white one.iPhone 15 Pro in Black Titanium and White TitaniumThe titanium frame has been treated to a matte finish instead of the previous generation's glossy stainless steel, which is a two-fold development. On the one hand, it makes the 15 Pros feel more like the non-Pros in terms of poshness - the finish was an easy differentiator up until now, and now both lineups are simple matte upon a passing glance.One of the more subtle changes this year, still related to the frame, is the roundover that it has where it meets the front and back panels. The older design had more pointy edges, and the 2023 frame feels more natural and thinner in the hand than the previous one. The matte finish improves the grip, too.Along those same lines is the slimming down of the bezels - you may not spot it at first, but the new iPhone 15 Pro is shorter and narrower by 0.9mm. With the displays being the same size, that means the new model has lost 0.45mm of border around the display. About as hard to notice at first, but still there, is the ever so slight rounding of the front glass edges towards the periphery - it's no Galaxy Note Edge, but it's not flat-flat either.Not much has changed, in principle, when it comes to what's where on the iPhone 15 Pro. The pill-shaped cutout for the selfie camera and the FaceID bits is unavoidable (at least until Apple discovers the fingerprint reader). Up above it is the earpiece, which also doubles as a second speaker. One of the ambient light sensors is behind the display, while the other is around the cameras on the back.The 'primary' speaker is on the bottom, as is the primary mic, both flanking what's one of the biggest hardware changes this year - the USB-C port.Bottom with USB-C port • Nothing up topThe long Side key is alone on the right - it is used for Lock/Wake up, power on, Apple Pay, and also participates in taking screenshots and powering off, restarting or emergency menu activation.Finally, the left side of the iPhone 15 Pro houses the SIM tray (unless you're in the US, where iPhones are e-SIM-only), the two volume keys and the new Action key, which is like a 50% smaller version of one of these buttons. This new Action key replaces the old Mute switch.Power button on the right • SIM slot, volume and Action keys on the rightThe Action key triggers on/off when you long press it. There are a few predefined actions - silencer, torch, magnifier, camera shortcut, Focus, Voice Memo, Shortcut, and No Action. The Shortcut option allows you to assign any configuration you've set up within the shortcut app and opens thousands of possibilities.The Action key is supposed to be used more than a Mute switch, and for that we are not sure if its unchanged position is the best one. We guess only time will tell and getting used to it might help, it just doesn't come naturally to reach all the way there frequently.The back of the iPhone 15 Pro is made of matte anti-reflective glass, but the Apple logo in the middle is mirror-like. Also reflective is the glass plaque that's the base of the camera assembly. It contains three metal rings - one for each camera, plus the LED flash, LiDAR scanner, ambient light sensor, and a mic.Naturally, with a camera bump this big, the iPhone 15 Pro does wobble if placed on a table with no case on. It's not quite as pronounced as on the Max, though, so there's that.The Apple iPhone 15 Pro measures 146.6x70.6x8.3mm, which means it's 0.4mm thicker than last year's model, but ever so slightly smaller in footprint, as established. More important to the pocketability, however, is the reduction in weight from 206g to 187g. That makes the 15 Pro a much more enticing proposition for someone looking for a premium handset that's both compact and anything close to lightweight - the 14 Pro could only pass for compact.--- PAGE 3 ---6.1-inch Retina OLEDYou can count on Apple to outfit an iPhone Pro with an industry-leading display, and the one on the 15 Pro is just that. Just as great as what the 15 Pro Max has, only smaller, the panel here is a beauty to look at.That was true on the 14 Pro as well, and the 15 Pro's specs don't appear to have changed. The 6.1-inch LTPO OLED has an 1179x2556px resolution in a 19.5:9 aspect ratio with a pixel density of 460ppi. Dolby Vision is supported; brightness should be able to reach 2000nits outdoors, and the adaptive refresh rate can vary between 1Hz and 120Hz. Proprietary labels like Super Retina, XDR, and ProMotion each signify one of those capabilities in Apple speak.As before, we weren't able to get quite as many nits out of the iPhone 15 Pro as promised, but the 1786nits we did measure (with Adaptive brightness turned on) means that iPhones remain brighter than anything else on the market by a wide margin - Samsung's brightest, the Galaxy S23 Ultra is some 500nits behind.When operating the slider manually, the iPhone 15 Pro was good for 845nits - the Galaxy S23 Ultra almost matches that. The Pro iPhones are nicely consistent in their results - both in Adaptive brightness mode, and when you're in charge of the scrubber yourself.Max display brightness testWhite test pattern, 75% fill (nits)

1080 x 2400 pxColor accuracyApple doesn't do color modes on the iPhones - instead, the panels come factory-calibrated. While the display does support a wide color gamut and covers the Display P3 color space (Apple's flavor of the more widely used DCI-P3), in most apps, the iPhone 15 Pro targets the sRGB color space. That's also the case for the software we use for testing purposes, and we got impressive readings for color accuracy for our set of test swatches, with the average dE2000 being around 0.8. That's true whether you're at the minimum 2 nits, 200nits, or the maximum manual brightness of 800+ nits.Refresh rateApple isn't known for giving you a ton of freedom or options, so there's no user control over refresh rate - the phone knows best, and it will dynamically adjust it depending on the use case and content. It should drop down to 1Hz when displaying a static picture and for the always-on/standby modes. Just like last year, web pages may scroll at a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, but any moving embedded content will be rendered at 60fps.All benchmarks were capped at 60Hz, meaning there is no high frame rate support right out of the box, and it is up to the developer to unlock it. There are numerous HFR games in the App Store, though, so don't worry; you can squeeze the maximum out of the new GPU.Streaming and HDRThe iPhone 15 Pro display is certified for both HDR10 and Dolby Vision support. The iPhone has all the necessary DRM certifications, as you would expect, allowing third-party services like Netflix or YouTube to offer HDR streams.There is one more thing worth mentioning - Apple does its HDR video playback in a very flexible way since it's not necessary for the content to be displayed full-screen for HDR to work. It can just work on the portion of the display that has the video playing, which is a bit of a surreal experience the first time you encounter it.Haptic feedbackThe iPhone's haptics have always been some of the best on the market, and that's also the case on the iPhone 15 Pro. Very subtle or more powerful as needed, but always well-judged, the vibrations provided by the Taptic engine make for a very pleasant tactile interaction with the iPhone.Apple iPhone 15 Pro battery lifeThe iPhone 15 Pro is equipped with a battery rated at 3274mAh. A whopping 74mAh more than the 14 Pro's capacity, we'd hardly call it an upgrade - probably that's just what the engineers were able to squeeze in the available space this time around. The 15 Pro Max does come with a noticeably larger 4,441mAh cell and, as usual, is the better option for maximum longevity.As one would expect, the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't shine with particularly impressive battery life, especially compared to its siblings in the iPhone 15 family, but it does seem to outperform the Google Pixel 8 and the vanilla Galaxy S23. That's true if you are comparing the Active Use Score. Looking past the overall score, you can see the iPhone 15 Pro outperforming the competition in the screen-on tests like video playback, web browsing and gaming.
Expand to reveal our legacy battery test (Endurance rating). How we test now.The iPhone 15 Pro is equipped with a battery rated at 3274mAh. A whopping 74mAh more than the 14 Pro's capacity, we'd hardly call it an upgrade - probably that's just what the engineers were able to squeeze in the available space this time around. The 15 Pro Max does come with a noticeably larger 4,441mAh cell and, as usual, is the better option for maximum longevity.That's not to say that the 15 Pro is bad in this respect. Well, it sort of is when it comes to voice call duration - iPhones traditionally score low in this test, and the 15 Pro's 18-ish hours are about what we'd expect. In the onscreen tests, however, the small Pro posts solid results, about on par with last year's model.All things considered, the iPhone 15 Pro's Endurance rating works out to 86h - coincidentally, the same as on the 14 Pro.Our battery tests were automated thanks to SmartViser, using its viSerDevice app. The endurance rating denotes how long the battery charge will last you if you use the device for an hour of telephony, web browsing, and video playback daily. More details can be found here.Video test carried out in 60Hz refresh rate mode. Web browsing test done at the display's highest refresh rate whenever possible. Refer to the respective reviews for specifics. To adjust the endurance rating formula to match your own usage - check out our all-time battery test results chart.Charging speedYou won't be finding a charger in the iPhone 15 Pro's retail box, as has been the case with iPhones since the 12 in 2020. The phones' specs pages list claims for charging speed "with 20W adapter or higher", implying that anything more powerful than that wouldn't make a difference in speed.That's sort of the case, since in our testing, the iPhone 15 Pro peaked at around 19W with good true-to-spec USB PowerDelivery chargers. We say 'sort of', because when firing up the display, the power meter would show something like 22-23W - so technically, if you're charging the phone while using it, you just might be able to keep it charging at the same rate as when it's idling, but for that you'd need a charger that can go above the 20W mark.Anyways, that's beside the point for our testing methodology, which assumes an idle (but still powered on) device. We used a 20W Apple adapter for our testing, as usual.We clocked a full charge from flat to take 1:33h on the 15 Pro, a minor improvement over the previous generation and tangibly quicker than the 15 Pro Max. The small Pro is also better than the large Pro at the intermediate checkpoints.Essentially, the 15 Pro is tied with rival Samsungs for charging speed at the early stages, though the Samsungs don't taper off as strongly and get to 100% earlier. The iPhone is way quicker than what you can get out of a Pixel (albeit that's a year-old Pixel 7 Pro, we're talking about), but then high-end models from China put the iPhone to shame (and the ones in this chart aren't even the fastest).Charging speed

20W PDThe iPhone 15 Pro supports wireless charging up to 7.5W with Qi-compliant charging pads, though the latest iPhone listing at the WPC (the governing body for wireless charging) is for the iPhone SE (2022) - there are no entries there for numbered iPhone models after the 11.Coincidentally, starting with the 12 generation and now including this 15 Pro model, iPhones have had MagSafe wireless charging. They can take up to 15W from the magnetically attaching puck that you can buy separately (you'd still need an adapter to power it, though, and it needs to be powerful enough).If you want to get the maximum longevity out of your iPhone's battery, the Optimized Battery Charging option in Battery settings should help. It allows the iPhone to adapt its charging curves to your charging patterns (mostly related to overnight charging and your sleep routine), so it minimizes the time the battery spends at 100%. It will charge quickly (well, iPhone-quickly) up to 80% and will then only finish things off just before it thinks you're going to need the phone. Upon reaching 100%, the phone stops using the charger, cutting off any current going in.The new iPhones support one new Battery Health option, which should prolong its lifespan even more - an 80% charge limit. This will make the iPhone charge up to 80% and never go up.Speaker testThe usual hybrid stereo speaker is employed on the iPhone 15 Pro - the earpiece acts as a second channel, joining the dedicated bottom speaker to provide a stereo experience. When held in landscape, the phone respects the left-right orientation, and it will switch channels to match the way you're holding it. In portrait, on the other hand, the earpiece is in charge of the right channel - most other phones assign the left channel, not that it really matters all that much. In any case, each speaker will still output some of the 'opposite' channel, but at a lower volume.Bottom speaker • Top speaker/earpieceThe iPhone 15 Pro returned much the same result for loudness as the 14 Pro, placing it in the 'Good' category in our testing, one level below the 15 Pro Max (which, in turn, is on par with the old Max).Quality is excellent as usual, though the sound profile has changed somewhat noticeably compared to the previous generation - a change that we didn't quite hear on the Max. The 15 Pro has gained some extra thump in the low end from the already pretty boomy 14 Pro, but also maintains the likeable rendition of vocals and the crispy treble. High praise for this one.Use the Playback controls to listen to the phone sample recordings (best use headphones). We measure the average loudness of the speakers in LUFS. A lower absolute value means a louder sound. A look at the frequency response chart will tell you how far off the ideal "0db" flat line is the reproduction of the bass, treble, and mid frequencies. You can add more phones to compare how they differ. The scores and ratings are not comparable with our older loudspeaker test. Learn more about how we test here.--- PAGE 4 ---Apple iOS 17All new iPhones come with Apple's iOS 17 out of the box. The new iOS version is the most insignificant update ever, no matter what Apple may try to sell you. It brings a new Standby mode, highly customizable Contact Posters, Password sharing with friends, offline maps in Maps, updated Messages with automatic SMS code deletion, and interactive widgets - to name a few of the changes and to give you an idea of their magnitude.We talked at length about iOS 17 when we reviewed the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and we'd invite you to check out the software section of that review - things are essentially the same on the 15 Pro non-Max.Connectivity - USB-C, finallyWe also mentioned the newly-introduced USB-C port's capabilities for video output in the Pro Max's review, but we feel that the move away from Lightning is such a big deal that we're including the following paragraph here anyway.The new USB-C port on the iPhone 15 Pros adheres to the USB 3.0 standard and supports up to 10Gbps transfer speeds - compare that to the USB 2.0-compliant vanilla iPhone 15s and their 480Mbps data transfer cap.Video output is supported as well (Display port DP) via Type-C Alt mode, which means that most standard Type-C hubs with a video interface should be able to get an image from the phone. By default, you get a mirror of the display without any other fancy options like a dedicated desktop mode or anything of the sort. In other words, it does a simple screen mirror for the UI.In terms of resolution, the iPhone appears to be outputting in 4K (2160p) or at least near that, but in a 19.5:9 aspect ratio to match the phone's display - the TVs we connected it to, reported a 2160p signal.However, certain apps behave differently; some, like the Photos app and Netflix, offer dedicated casting of content to the display in a 16:9 aspect ratio. Other video apps, like YouTube, however, don't have said dedicated video casting behavior and are stuck at 19.5:9 aspect ratio and 4K resolution, leaving the image both letter-boxed and pillar-boxed. There is seemingly no way to control this behavior, and it is a bit of an inconsistent mess.The iPhone does offer some display settings when connected to an external display, mainly dealing with the selection of HDR or SDR color mode where supported, as well as a toggle for the ability to automatically adapt and match the output resolution to the content being played.All iPhone 15 models also support USB Host mode, and we successfully hooked up a mouse and keyboard. The keyboard started working instantly, but getting the mouse to pick up and actually show an on-screen cursor required enabling the Assistive Touch option in Settings. USB thumb drives, card readers, and hard drives work fine and automatically mount and appear in the Files app. Compatible external storage is also recognized by the Camera app, and you can output ProRes videos there.Various USB-C game controller/phone holders are supported, too. Anything that works on Android via USB-C should work on the new iPhones as hassle-free.Performance, benchmarks, stress testsThe iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are powered by Apple's latest invention - the Apple A17 Pro chipset. The Bionic moniker is no more, as this new piece of silicon brings the iPhone models to a whole new level with console-grade graphics and hardware ray tracing acceleration - Apple's marketing speak, of course.The new Apple A17 Pro chipset is the first ever mass-market SoC manufactured by TSMC on a 3nm process node, and it contains 19 billion transistors. The CPU still has a 6-core architecture with 2 performance cores clocked at 3.78GHz and 4 efficiency cores working at 2.02GHz. Apple claims the performance cores are 10% faster than those in the A16 Bionic, and that's easy to believe, seeing how their clock speed is 10% higher too.The GPU is a 6-core unit, which Apple claims is 20% faster than its predecessor in peak performance. It enables hardware-accelerated Ray Tracing, which is supposedly 4 times faster than the software-based Ray Tracing on last year's chip. This means the GPU won't offer that much, if any, performance bump over the last year 5-core GPU, but it will make the raytracing toll on the hardware way lighter (and thus better graphics).Apple has such confidence in this GPU that it has made sure it has console games soon after launch. Apple has secured Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 Remake, and Assassin's Creed Mirage (the latest AC title!) ports for the iPhone 15 Pro - these will come in early 2024.There is no denying that these games will be optimized for the new iPhones and will work well. Furthermore, it is quite exciting to see popular recent console titles coming to iOS.The Neural Engine is a 16-core unit that Apple says is twice as fast as last year's chip for machine learning operations.The A17 Pro SoC features a Display Engine with hardware AV1 decoding and a ProRes codec. The chip allows the new iPhone 15 Pro models to capture 4k 60fps in ProRes RAW, along with support for the industry standard ACES color profile.Finally, the new Pro models feature 8GB LPDDR5 RAM. The small-size Pro starts at 128GB of storage, which rubs us the wrong way - at that price point and with a Pro in the name, 256GB should have been the base storage, as is the case on the Pro Max. 256GB, 512GB and 1TB NVMe storage options are also available.On the iPhone 15 Pro we're getting the same results for CPU performance in GeekBench that we did on the 15 Pro Max, which wasn't our experience with the previous generation. So, in a way, the 15 Pro is more of a step up from the 14 Pro than the Max is - 17% in the single-core test and 13% in the multi-core (those numbers are 10% and 6% when comparing the 15 Pro Max and the 14 Pro Max).GeekBench 6

1179 x 2556 pxIn the sustained performance benchmarks, the iPhone 15 Pro proved a little better under continuous CPU load than the 15 Pro Max, with the APSI Bench benchmark returning an 85% stability rating (we got 78% on the Max). The 3D Mark Wildlife Stress test yielded a 76% score after a 20-minute run, though performance would drop further in subsequent runs.APSI Bench • 3D Mark--- PAGE 5 ---Essentially the same four cameras as before, no 5x telephotoThe one major principal difference between the two sizes of iPhone Pros this year is the telephoto camera - the 15 Pro Max gets the new tetraprism 5x module, while the 15 Pro keeps the 3x unit of the 14 Pro. As usual, both the selfie camera and the rear trio are further assisted - whether it's the 3D ToF camera on the front or the LiDAR system on the back. In all the immediately observable ways (read, the specs), the 15 Pro's camera hardware is the same as the one on the 14 Pro, though Apple does insist there are some differences.Starting with the main camera on the back, the 15 Pro has a 48MP sensor with 1.22µm pre-binned pixels and second-generation sensor-shift stabilization. The lens' focal length has a 24mm equivalent, and the aperture is f/1.78.While the key numbers look unchanged, Apple is introducing a few new imaging possibilities for the iPhone 15 Pros. You can now capture 48MP HEIF/JPG images alongside 48MP ProRAW. They've also come up with 28mm and 35mm equivalent digital zoom modes, and the iPhone will let you pick one of these focal lengths as your default setting.The iPhone 15 Pro Max debuts the first periscope camera on an iPhone. But, as established, the non-Max doesn't get that. Instead, it's the same 3x unit from the 14 Pros, with the numbers looking unchanged from the 13 Pros - a 12MP 1/3.5" imager with a 77mm equivalent lens with an f/2.8 aperture and OIS.The ultrawide is also carried over from the previous generation, but at least that one was upgraded last year and doesn't date all the way back to the 13 Pros. It's based on a 1/2.55" sensor with a 1.4µm pixel pitch and 100% focus pixels, which is coupled with a 13mm f/2.2 lens. Macro photography is supported, of course. This camera has a new anti-reflective coating, improved HDR and better Night Mode.The selfie camera uses a 12MP 1/3.6" sensor again with a bright f/1.9 aperture on its 23mm lens and supports autofocus. There is also OIS, which is a rare feature on a selfie cam.Finally, the 9-LED flash from last year is here to stay - it has the LEDs arranged within a 3x3 grid. Each of those can be independently adjusted and fired. It's a true-tone flash with slow sync.Camera app and featuresThe viewfinder has stayed mostly intact since iOS 16. You can see outside of the current camera's field of view thanks to the precise calibration of the three cameras, allowing you to see what will be left outside the frame in real time.Apple's image processing includes all legacy features - Smart HDR, Night Mode, and Deep Fusion - and last year's Photonic Engine.All enhancements, except for Night Mode, are out of the users' control. The Night Mode icon pops up automatically when a low-light scene presents itself, and you will see the seconds suggested next to the Night Mode icon. You can choose longer exposure or altogether disable the Night Mode, but you can't really force it on if the phone doesn't want to engage it.Macro mode is available, too. Enabled by the ultrawide camera's autofocusing capability, it's an option you only get on the recent Pro models.As usual, all cameras talk to each other, so they already know the correct exposure and tone mapping settings when you switch between them. This applies to both stills and videos.The camera interface has 0.5x, 1x, 2x, and 5x toggles. The macro toggle appears automatically if you are close enough for such a photo. If you tap on the 1x toggle, you will zoom to 28mm equiv (1.2x), and an extra tap will get you 35mm (1.5x). As we have established, those are crops and upscales from the standard output, but pretty good ones, nevertheless.You swipe between modes and have a couple of settings you can uncover with an upward swipe - flash, night mode, live photo, photo aspect, exposure compensation, and filters. In video mode, you can change the resolution and frame rate from the viewfinder.Camera UIPortrait mode is available on the main, tele and selfie cameras. There is a new Portrait feature on the new iPhones - basically, after-the-fact Portrait mode. The iPhone will detect when you capture a person, pet, or any subject that could be suitable for a portrait mode shot and automatically capture a depth map. And if you decide you want to blur the background later - you can do it from the Photos app. Neat! We guess apps like Focos might become obsolete soon.We also noticed when the camera app was going to capture a depth map, it displayed an F shortcut on the viewfinder in the regular Photo mode. If you use it, you will capture a portrait right away without going into the Portrait mode.RAW capture is supported across all cameras, and it can shoot in 48MP for the primary one if you have enabled Resolution and RAW control. This will add a new toggle called JPEG Max.There is this feature called Photographic Styles, which automatically edits a photo, one element at a time (applying different corrections to the subject and background, for example). You can choose between Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm, and Cool. You can tune each of these modes to your liking and set your preferred one as default. It's like filters but more permanent.Camera UIDaylight photo qualityThe primary camera on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro saves in 24MP by default, though options for 12MP and 48MP are also available. The 48MP sensor still uses a Quad-Bayer color filter, which means the 24MP photos the iPhone saves are a product of multi-shot stacking of both 12MP and 48MP images - that's how Apple detailed it in the keynote.We were somewhat surprised by how the 24MP daylight photos from the main camera turned out. We could differentiate finer detail than in 12MP mode in pretty much everything - foliage, labels, building decorations, the mountains in the distance. There was no detail increase on moving objects, so there's only so much advanced processing that can be done on the fly.Long story short - there is more detail to be seen in the 24MP photos, and we think it is worth saving in this default resolution. Plus - the file size difference isn't too dramatic at about 1MB-1.5MB increase per HEIF image (say from 2.5MB to 3.8MB).From a more global perspective, the iPhone's auto white balance is usually spot on, and the color rendition is a 1:1 match to real life, which is not necessarily high praise. This conservative rendition has been Apple's choice for several years, and we're not really fans. If, like us, you're not liking the default output, you can use one of the extra Photographic Styles - for personal use, we'd go with a more saturated one immediately after we are done with the review. This is not a filter you need to select every time, but a color preset that is always used unless you change it.Daylight samples, main camera (1x), 24MPHere's how a few of these scenes look if shot in 12MP mode - those are basically the same as on last year's iPhone Pros.Daylight samples, main camera (1x), 12MPApple dedicated a few moments from its nearly 1-hour iPhone 15 presentation to the new Pro models' custom 28mm and 35mm shooting modes. Technically, you get a cropped 28mm or 35mm portion from the native 24mm primary lens, and you get it in the same 24MP resolution as the default 24mm images. Apple says that with the iPhone 15 Pro, "it's like having seven pro lenses in your pocket".It's a convenient feature for those who prefer a focal length narrower than 24mm. You tap the 1x mode in the camera to go to 28mm (1.2x) and once again to 35mm (1.5x). You can even make either the default camera focal length, which is extra convenient.We attempted a little experiment around this new functionality. We manually cropped from 24mm 24MP shots and upscaled them up to 24MP using Photoshop's Preserve Details 2.0 resampling method. Looking at the results side-by-side, we'd say there isn't a discernible difference between Apple's 28mm shot and our simple crop-and-upscale. However, the functionality does undeniably offer a layer of convenience.Daylight samples, main camera (1.2x, 28mm), 24MPDaylight samples, main camera (1.5x, 35mm), 24MPThe 48MP sensor and Apple's next-level processing allow the iPhone 15 Pro to offer a 2x zoom mode with very good results. Those are always saved in 12MP, no matter the selected resolution for the main camera.Daylight samples, main camera (2x)The 15 Pro's 3x telephoto camera comes straight out of the previous generation, and the images it captures reflect that fact. We're getting sharp and detailed shots with a likable, natural look. The colors are accurate, the contrast is high, and the dynamic range is what you'd expect from an iPhone.Daylight samples, telephoto camera (3x)The thing is, with the iPhone 15 Pro Max having a 5x telephoto camera, you may be feeling like you're missing out if you opt for the smaller 15 Pro. We shot a few quick comparisons, and we wouldn't say that Max's native 5x output is that much better than the non-Max's digitally zoomed-in 5x - if at all.Telephoto comparison, 5x: iPhone 15 Pro • iPhone 15 Pro MaxConversely, at the 3x zoom level, the 15 Pro's 3x telephoto camera results are substantially superior to the 15 Pro Max's output that stretches the main camera's capabilities beyond what you can call a sharp image.Telephoto comparison, 3x: iPhone 15 Pro • iPhone 15 Pro MaxThe 12MP photos from the ultrawide shooter are among the better ones we've seen from such a camera, though they do have their flaws. We're not loving the high-frequency detail like foliage, which has an excessively processed look. They do offer high resolved detail, however, and outstanding sharpness all the way to the very corners. The unexciting color rendition isn't universally likable, but the consistency is praiseworthy nonetheless.Daylight samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x)The ultrawide camera also supports dual-pixel autofocus, and it can focus down to 3-4cm, which can be useful both for the macro mode or just general photography of nearby objects.Macro mode is accessed somewhat unintuitively - you must be at 1x in the viewfinder, and as soon as you are really close to a subject, the phone can automatically switch to the ultrawide camera in macro mode - with a field of view matching the primary camera. This means that it will crop and then upscale, a behavior you can disable with the toggle that appears in the viewfinder (and you can keep it disabled too, in the Preserve Settings submenu).The macro shots we snapped with the ultrawide camera are excellent - the subject in focus is rendered very well - detailed, sharp, and colorful. The contrast across those photos is great, and the dynamic range is commendably wide. The colors from this up-close are surprisingly lovely.The results obtained that way are solid, with good detail given the way they're captured. Depending on what you're going to do with them, the narrower field of view may be more important than the absolute per-pixel detail, which does suffer from the upscale.'Macro' samplesAlternatively, you can just shoot with the 0.5x camera in its native FoV, but that would place you so close to the subject that you'll need to be extra careful about casting a shadow.Portrait modeAs was the case on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the 15 Pro defaults at 2x portraits, but you also have options that use the native field of view of the main camera (1x) as well as 3x coming from the telephoto.Starting with the default 2x shots (saved in 12MP), we're getting excellent subject separation and convincing background blur. The colors are looking great, as is dynamic range. The one thing that could be better is detail when looking at the subject at 1:1 magnification, which reveals some upscaling at play. Even then, particularly in good light, you can still have some decently sharp detail.Portrait mode samples, main camera (2x)The 1x photos offer a wider field of view, ideal for shots with a bit more context around your subject. They're saved in the same resolution you've picked for regular photos in the settings - so either the out-of-the-box default 24MP (as we shot them) or 12MP. We reckon these turned out excellent - better than the ones we got on the 15 Pro Max for one reason or another.Portrait mode samples, main camera (1x)The telephoto camera's 3x zoom portraits offer possibly the best perspective for head-and-shoulders style framing, and they do that without throwing you in the far end of the room quite like the Pro Max's 5x camera does. Pixel-level detail is also better on the Pro's 3x than it is on the Max's 5x, and even in dimmer indoor conditions where other phones' telephoto cameras struggle with portraits, the iPhone 15 Pro maintains excellent quality.Portrait mode samples, telephoto camera (3x)SelfiesThis year's Pros use the same selfie camera Apple introduced last year - a 12MP sensor with 23mm f/1.9 OIS lens and autofocus. The camera still offers two FoV settings in the viewfinder - the slightly zoomed-in 7MP crop that is equivalent to a 30mm field of view and the full 12MP mode, which has a 23mm equivalent FoV.If you hold the phone in portrait orientation, selfies are cropped to 7MP to provide a tighter framing, but rotate the phone horizontally, and you get more of the scene with the phone automatically switching to the wider 12MP mode. You can also switch between those two modes manually by tapping on the arrows near the shutter button.The 12MP selfies we shot on the iPhone are superb - there plenty of detail, the skin tones and color rendition overall are great, and we have nothing but praise for the contrast and dynamic range.Apple's processing once again shows its true self as some facial features come out a bit too pronounced by sharpening and micro-contrast enhancement. While we are not fans of the skin-smoothing algorithms used by other brands, Apple seems to be on the exact opposite side of the spectrum, which is not very likable either.Selfie samplesLow-light image qualityThe way Apple handles Night mode and low-light photography, in general, has remained unchanged this generation - Night mode triggers automatically in low-light scenes and usually chooses 1s exposure for the primary camera and 2s-3s for the rest. You can choose a different exposure time or disable the Night Mode. Once disabled, it will stay this way until you enable it or restart the camera app. However, there's no way to force Night mode on - if the phone thinks it doesn't need it, that's that.The Night Mode shots are always saved in 12MP, and so are the 2x zoomed photos, as we established. The only way to get a 24MP nighttime photo is to disable the Night Mode - or, you know, shoot scenes that are lit well enough that the iPhone deems it unnecessary, which turned out to be a lot of scenes.Starting out with those Night mode-less photos, we're looking at somewhat dark exposures with high contrast and tonal extremes that could use a bit of extra development. In other words, these aren't the expressive shots with well-contained highlights and boosted shadows you'd get from the aggressive Night modes on the market. Instead, these are more realistic representations of reality, which can read as a compliment or a complaint, depending on where you stand. Either way, we're very much liking the color rendition - saturation is great, and the auto white balance is on point. Detail is generally very good, but it's just that you won't be seeing a whole lot of it in the shadows - give it a nudge with the slider in your favorite editing software, though, and it will show up.Low-light samples, main camera (1x), Auto Night Mode (did NOT engage)Next up are the scenes where Night mode did kick in, so those images come out at 12MP. Further down below are the same scenes with Night mode disabled, so you can appreciate the differences and, indeed, for the most part you can tell why the iPhone chose to use the extra processing.The Night mode shots have notably better shadow development. Then again, we're not seeing a ton of attention given to the highlights, which are about as blown out as without Night mode. Overall, the Night mode exposure is more in line with what we'd like to get from the scene.Low-light samples, main camera (1x), Auto Night Mode (did engage)Low-light samples, main camera (1x), Auto Night Mode (disabled)The above holds true at 2x zoom as well, and that makes sense - it's the same camera capturing the shots. Whether it was a scene that wasn't dark enough for Night mode, or it was one that the iPhone did choose to enhance with it, we're seeing impressive results. Detail is great - to the point that we'd say that no dedicated 2x camera on the market can rival it. Again, we'd probably take a bit more shadow development, but that could be a personal preference.Low-light samples, main camera (2x), Auto Night Mode (did NOT engage)Low-light samples, main camera (2x), Auto Night Mode (did engage)Low-light samples, main camera (2x), Auto Night Mode (disabled)The telephoto camera was even less inclined to engage Night mode - perhaps that's got something to do with the tighter framing making the overall captured scene less contrasty, or it's simply because you only want to shoot well-lit subjects in the distance. In any case, we're getting nicely detailed images - admittedly, with some noise in them, but not to a point where it's an issue. Dynamic range is good; colors are spot-on - we can't really complain.Low-light samples, telephoto camera (3x), Auto Night Mode (did NOT engage)That's also true in the darker scenes where Night mode did intervene. Compare that to the images with Night mode fully disabled - 3 out of 4 of those were a digital zoom from the main camera and are super soft; the last one is just plain too dark.Low-light samples, telephoto camera (3x), Auto Night Mode (did engage)Low-light samples, telephoto camera (3x), Auto Night Mode (disabled)On the ultrawide, you'd probably like a more trigger-happy Night mode implementation than what Apple is giving you, because, in some scenes, you end up with just too much darkness. Brighter scenes do look nicer. Sharpness is okay, colors are great.Low-light samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), Auto Night Mode (did NOT engage)In the scenes that we did get Night mode, things do look livelier and better exposed, to the point where we're wondering why we didn't get the same treatment for most of the above scenes.Low-light samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), Auto Night Mode (did engage)Low-light samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), Auto Night Mode (disabled)Once you're done with the real-world samples, head over to our Photo compare tool to see how the Apple iPhone 15 Pro stacks up against the competition.Apple iPhone 15 Pro against the iPhone 14 Pro and the Galaxy S23 in our Photo compare tool--- PAGE 6 ---Video recordingThe iPhone 15 Pro can record video at up to 4K60 with all of its four cameras. 4K24 is also available across the board if you're after a more cinematic motion look. All videos benefit from class-leading stabilization - Apple calls this cinematic video stabilization (with Enhanced Stabilization being ON by default). The slow-mo options max out at 1080p at 240fps.Action mode is present - it uses the ultrawide camera at 60fps. It crops heavily from the 4K footage (that's why the resolution is 2.8K) and delivers super smooth and incredibly stabilized video. It is available to all rear cameras and can be shot at any resolution and frame rate, but, as we pointed out, its main hardware is the ultrawide camera at 2.8K@60fps.The iPhone 15 Pro supports Cinematic mode (rack focus) up to 4K at 30fps.ProRes can now be shot in 4K60 if you hook up an external USB 3 storage drive. When recording internally, you're limited to 4K30 on iPhone 15 Pros 256GB and up, while the 128GB version is capped at 1080p30. Support for Log encoding is also present for ProRes. And there will be an option for Spatial Video capturing, so you can play your iPhone videos in 3D on Apple Vision Pro.You can capture HDR videos straight into the Dolby Vision format up to the same maximum 4K60. You can edit these videos on the go on your phone; you can upload them on YouTube or any other popular platform or even send them to your friends. The Dolby Vision information is saved outside of the video stream, so the video will look normal to any non-HDR player/screen and will be color-boosted on any Dolby Vision-compatible player and display.You also have a choice between H.265 HEVC and H.264 video encoders. The High-Efficiency mode uses H.265 and is mandatory for 4K60 and HDR footage, while the More Compatible mode (H.264) provides easier playback across different devices.The iPhone 15 Pro Max, just like the previous iPhones, captures wide stereo audio for the videos at about 192kbps.Before we begin, we want to applaud the iPhone camcorder for shooting equally great 30fps and 60fps videos across all resolutions. And even with the always-on electronic stabilization, which usually softens other videos, the iPhones still deliver outstanding video quality.Daylight video qualityIt's hard to fault the video output of any of the iPhone 15 Pro's 4 cameras. The main unit's 4K clips have excellent levels of resolved detail and pair that with natual-looking processing. Dynamic range is very wide, while also maintaining high overall contrast. The auto white balance is dependable and color saturation is really likable - more so than in stills.The 2x zoomed videos are a bit softer, but still notably better than anything we can think of that's been captured at 2x on a primary camera.The telephoto's 4K is also looking great, with matching colors and a wide dynamic range. Pixel-level sharpness is a notch below what the main camera can do, but it's still plenty good enough.The ultrawide maintains the same overall look, so consistency is once again a strong suit of the iPhone camera system. Sharpness is good on the ultrawide, all the way to the corners.Selfie videos are also super nice, with lively skin tones and wide dynamic range, though sharpness isn't the absolute best.Low-light video qualityLow-light videos from the main camera are very good. The iPhone exposes nicely bright in these conditions, maintains a wide dynamic range and excellent color rendition. Examining on a pixel level, you can't really call this pin-sharp footage, but it's very good nonetheless and the camera captures good detail.A long-standing peculiarity (possibly even an 'issue') with iPhone video capture at night is the ghosting from point light sources that results in bright, colorful spots from internal reflections in the lens. It's present here too.2x clips are a bit hazier, but very much usable still, particularly if you avoid pixel-peeping.The telephoto, on the other hand, doesn't particularly enjoy capturing videos in the dark. We found the iPhone tends to switch to a crop from the main camera in these conditions, resulting in rather low sharpness.The ultrawide does fare better than the telephoto in terms of sharpness, though it's not setting the standard either. We do like the bright exposure, wide dynamic range and the color rendition.StabilizationWhere iPhones do usually set the standard is in stabilization and the 15 Pro is no different. All three cameras offer class-leading results, whether we're talking about ironing out walking shake, panning, or just keeping steady when pointing the phone in one direction.Here's a glimpse of how the Apple iPhone 15 Pro compares to rivals in our Video compare tool. Head over there for the complete picture.Apple iPhone 15 Pro against the iPhone 14 Pro and the Galaxy S23 in our Video compare tool--- PAGE 7 ---CompetitionAn iPhone's competition most often comprises other iPhones - be they older ones, the other size from the same lineup, or one from the other lineup. In that sense, you need to have your priorities all figured out when picking the right iPhone for you.iPhone 15 Pro in front of iPhone 15 Pro MaxFor example, if you want the absolute best iPhone on the market, the 15 Pro isn't that. The 15 Pro Max will get you a longer-reaching telephoto camera, better battery life and more screen estate, though conversely, it will take up more room in your pocket, and it's also more expensive (€250/$200).On the other hand, if you're looking to save some money (€300/$200), you could give up on the Pro and get the vanilla iPhone 15 - not only is it the same size as the 15 Pro, but it's tangibly lighter, which can be a priority. The 15 is nowhere as good a cameraphone as the 15 Pro - no telephoto, no AF on the UW, and less fancy main camera.An interesting middle ground is the iPhone 14 Pro. Apple may have discontinued it, but we reckon there's ample stock at third-party retailers, and for €150 less you can have almost the same phone as the 15 Pro - minus the USB-C port, the latest intermediate zoom modes, the newest chipset (last year's is fine), and the titanium frame (which may actually be an advantage for the previous generation).Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max • Apple iPhone 15 • Apple iPhone 14 ProIf you're OS-agnostic or just like jumping ship every now and then, or you may want something that Apple doesn't make yet, there are plenty of Android options you could entertain.Samsung's two foldables easily come to mind - there's no bendy iPhone just yet. The Galaxy Z Fold5 is perhaps the best bet if you're after the ultimate smartphone for productivity, while the Z Flip5 is more of a fashion statement with the benefit of some form of pocketability. If that last bit is a top priority, then the Zenfone 10 just might be able to entice you, while an Xperia 1 V could appeal to the right crowd with its extensive video recording chops.Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 • Samsung Galaxy Z Flip5 • Asus Zenfone 10 • Sony Xperia 1 VVerdictThe iPhone 15 Pro is a logical if not quite exciting, evolutionary step for the lineup. Small advancement in key areas go with continued refusal to improve on others, but Apple will be Apple. Perhaps that statement alone explains the fact that the new 5x telephoto only comes on the Pro Max and not the Pro, and we're bummed about it on principle, even if it's objectively not a big deal.The high price, scant retail bundle, iOS quirks, and heavy throttling sound like cons we've listed before and will continue to do so. On the other hand, traditional strong points of the iPhone are only getting stronger - like the upmarket build and in-hand feel, spectacular display, versatile camera system and great speakers. We're more than happy to welcome the USB-C port this year on iPhone too.Ultimately, the iPhone 15 Pro is what you'd expect it to be - the best one to date in size small. As usual, if you've already got an iPhone 14 Pro, there's no truly compelling reason to get a 15 Pro. However, if you're on an iPhone 13 Pro or older, or on one of the other branches of iPhone (like a vanilla 14 maybe), the 15 Pro will more easily make a convincing case for itself.ProsExquisite and now lighter design, water-resistant up to 6m deep.

Top-notch performance.
Every iPhone comes with at least five years of iOS updates.
Upgraded connectivity across the board, UWB2 too.
USB-C is here, and we love it.
Class-leading video capturing and stabilization, impressive Pro modes.
Superb daylight and nighttime photos from all cameras.ConsA lot more expensive than corresponding Android alternatives.
No charger in the box, and charging isn't particularly fast.
Apple's iOS restrictions can be off-putting to newcomers to the ecosystem.
The photo processing could benefit from less sharpening at times.
Limiting the 5x telephoto to just the Max feels arbitrary (and so is the 256GB base storage).
The rear glass is reportedly much more shatter-prone than before.Pricing
