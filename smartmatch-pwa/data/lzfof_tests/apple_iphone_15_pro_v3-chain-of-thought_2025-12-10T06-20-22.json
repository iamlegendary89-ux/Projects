    "summary_1_page": "The iPhone 15 Pro receives widespread praise for its premium titanium build, USB-C adoption, and class-leading A17 Pro performance. Reviewers highlight its excellent display quality (1786 nits peak brightness, 120Hz LTPO OLED) and versatile camera system, though note limitations in telephoto zoom compared to the Pro Max. Battery life averages 12-13 hours of active use, but slow charging (90 minutes for full charge) and occasional overheating under heavy loads are consistent criticisms. While iOS 17 offers polished software with long-term support expectations, the high starting price ($999 for 128GB) and minimal storage upgrades remain contentious points. The phone excels as a compact flagship but faces stiff competition from Android alternatives offering faster charging and better value.",
