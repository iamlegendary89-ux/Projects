    "summary_1_page": "The Apple iPhone 15 Pro features a titanium design that's lighter and more durable than previous models, alongside the new USB-C port for universal charging. Powered by the A17 Pro chip, it delivers top-tier performance for gaming and multitasking. The camera system includes a 48MP main sensor with 24MP default output, improved low-light capabilities, and excellent video recording, though it lacks the Pro Max's 5x zoom. The 6.1-inch OLED display offers 120Hz ProMotion and up to 2000 nits brightness. Battery life lasts up to 13 hours of active use, but charging remains slow at 20W. iOS 17 provides a clean experience with at least five years of software updates. However, the base model starts at $999 with only 128GB storage, and no charger is included.",
