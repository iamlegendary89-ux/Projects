    "summary_1_page": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 is a compact flagship featuring a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display (1080p, 120Hz, up to 2600 nits peak brightness) powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, delivering top-tier performance (Geekbench 10050, AnTuTu 2193701). It retains the same camera setup as its predecessor (50MP main, 10MP 3x telephoto, 12MP ultra-wide), which receives mixed reviews for lacking hardware innovation but benefits from software enhancements. Battery endurance averages 13-15 hours of active use with a 4000mAh cell, though 25W wired charging is criticized as slow. The phone runs One UI 7 on Android 15 with a 7-year update promise. Its lightweight design (162g) features IP68 rating and Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Key strengths include its compact form factor, powerful performance, and long software support, while drawbacks include unchanged camera hardware, slow charging, and PWM display flickering noted in reviews.",
