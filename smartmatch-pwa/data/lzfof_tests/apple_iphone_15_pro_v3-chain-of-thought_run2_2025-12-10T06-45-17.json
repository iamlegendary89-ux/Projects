    "summary_1_page": "The iPhone 15 Pro is a premium flagship offering exceptional performance with the A17 Pro chip, a vibrant 120Hz OLED display, and a durable titanium design. Its triple-camera system delivers excellent photo and video quality, though it lacks the Pro Max's 5x zoom. Battery life is solid with 12+ hours of active use, but charging remains slow at 20W. The switch to USB-C and new Action button are welcome additions. While expensive, it offers long-term software support and strong resale value. Key drawbacks include the 128GB base storage and occasional thermal throttling during intensive tasks.",

Video capabilities are industry-leading with ProRes/LOG support. Selfies are detailed but can be oversharpened. DXOMark score: 154."
