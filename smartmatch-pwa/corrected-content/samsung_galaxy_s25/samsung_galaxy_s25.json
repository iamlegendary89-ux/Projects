    "onePageSummary": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 maintains its position as a premium compact flagship with notable strengths in performance and design. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and 12GB RAM across all models (GSMArena, PhoneArena), it delivers top-tier benchmark results (Tom's Guide). The 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display remains excellent with 2600 nits peak brightness (GSMArena) and scores highly in DXOMark tests (157/200). One UI 7 on Android 15 brings refined software with a promised seven-year update policy (GSMArena). However, the phone shows minimal hardware upgrades from the S24 – particularly in cameras (unchanged since S22) where low-light performance and ultrawide quality lag behind competitors like Vivo X200 Pro Mini (NotebookCheck). Battery endurance is solid with efficient power management but hampered by slow 25W wired charging criticized across reviews (PhoneArena). Design refinements include a lighter build (162g) and IP68 rating (Android Central), though Gorilla Armor glass remains exclusive to Ultra models.",
    "pros": [
      "Compact lightweight design praised for comfort (mentioned: GSMArena, PhoneArena, NotebookCheck)",
      "Snapdragon 8 Elite offers best-in-class Android performance (cited: Tom's Guide, TechRadar)",
      "Bright 2600-nit AMOLED display with excellent color accuracy (noted: DXOMark)",
      "Seven years of OS updates ensure long-term viability (highlighted by all major sources)",
      "Improved AI features including Gemini integration and Now Bar (detailed: PhoneArena)"
    ],
    "cons": [
      "Identical camera hardware since Galaxy S22 generation (criticized by GSMArena)",
      "Slow 25W wired charging lags behind competitors (mentioned in all reviews)",
      "No Gorilla Armor glass despite Ultra model having it (noted by PhoneArena)",
      "Ultra-wideband (UWB) support missing on base model (flagged by NotebookCheck)",
      "128GB base storage with UFS 3.1 in entry model (criticized by multiple sources)"

      "Camera": {
        "score": 7.45,
        "explanation": "Main camera retains 50MP sensor from S22 with OIS (GSMArena). Low-light performance shows noise in telephoto/ultrawide (NotebookCheck). Video captures up to 8K30 but lacks autofocus on ultrawide - DXOMark highlights strong video in controlled lighting."

      "Battery Endurance": {
        "score": 6.82,
        "explanation": "4000mAh capacity matches S24 with improved efficiency from Snapdragon Elite (PhoneArena tested +15% gaming runtime). Charging capped at 25W wired/15W wireless - slower than Xiaomi/OnePlus flagships per TechRadar."
      },
      "Performance": {
        "score": 9.18,
        "explanation": "Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy dominates benchmarks - Geekbench Multi-core ~9600 vs S24's ~6800 (Tom's Guide). Sustained performance drops ~50% under load due to thermal limits (NotebookCheck)."

      "Display": {
        "score": 8.62,
        "explanation": "6.2\" FHD+ AMOLED scores DXOMark Display #4 globally with excellent readability outdoors. Criticisms include PWM dimming at only 240Hz affecting eye comfort (NotebookCheck) and missing anti-reflective coating."

      "Software Experience": {
        "score": 8.76,
        "explanation": "One UI 7 praised for redesign and Gemini/Bixby integration (Android Central). Bloatware noted by TechRadar but offset by industry-leading seven-year update commitment."

      "Design & Build": {
        "score": 9.04,
        "explanation": "162g weight (-5g vs S24) with IP68 rating and matte aluminum frame (GSMArena). Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protects both sides - lacks Ultra's Armor Glass per PhoneArena."

      "Longevity Value": {
        "score": 8.92,
        "explanation": "Seven-year update policy leads Android market (all sources). Price/performance ratio hurt by $799 base price matching Pixel/iPhone despite older cameras."
