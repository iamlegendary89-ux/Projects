    "onePageSummary": "The iPhone 15 Pro represents Apple's refined flagship experience with notable upgrades including a titanium frame reducing weight by 19g (GSMArena, TechRadar), USB-C connectivity for faster data transfers (Android Authority, GSMArena), and the powerful A17 Pro chip delivering console-grade gaming performance (NotebookCheck, PhoneArena). The camera system excels in video quality and main sensor performance (DXOMark score: 154/200), though low-light and ultrawide capabilities show minor weaknesses (PhoneArena, Android Authority). The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display boasts up to 2000 nits brightness and precise color accuracy (GSMArena, DXOMark), while iOS 17 offers polished software with long-term updates. However, slow 20W charging persists (all sources), base storage remains at 128GB ($999), and PWM flickering may affect sensitive users (NotebookCheck). Battery life averages 10-14 hours with efficient management but doesn't lead its class. Design improvements like the customizable Action Button enhance usability, though thermal throttling under sustained load was noted pre-update (Android Authority). While the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't revolutionize the series, it consolidates Apple's strengths in build quality, ecosystem integration, and performance—making it a compelling upgrade for iOS users seeking a compact flagship.",

        "score": 9.12,
        "explanation": "DXOMark score: 154/200 (6th globally). Main camera excels in daylight and video (GSMArena, TechRadar), with improved 24MP processing. Low-light shows noise in ultrawide (PhoneArena), and telephoto limited to 3x vs Pro Max's 5x (Tom's Guide). Video stabilization and ProRes LOG praised universally."

      "Battery Endurance": {
        "score": 7.8,
        "explanation": "GSMArena tested 86h endurance rating; real-world usage lasts ~13h browsing/6h gaming (NotebookCheck). Efficient A17 Pro aids longevity but 20W charging takes 90+ minutes (all sources). Capacity similar to predecessor at 3274mAh."
      },
      "Performance": {
        "score": 9.5,
        "explanation": "A17 Pro dominates benchmarks: Geekbench Multi-core ~7200 (PhoneArena), 30% faster GPU than A16. Sustained performance dips slightly under load (NotebookCheck stress tests). Ray tracing enables console ports like Resident Evil Village."

      "Display": {
        "score": 9.2,
        "explanation": "6.1-inch OLED hits 2000 nits HBM (GSMArena measured 1786 nits), Delta-E <1 for color accuracy. PWM flickering at 240Hz noted in low brightness (NotebookCheck). Dynamic Island and Always-On Display receive positive feedback."

      "Software Experience": {
        "score": 8.9,
        "explanation": "iOS 17 offers polished experience with Action Button customization and StandBy mode. Clean interface but less customizable than Android. Guaranteed updates for ~5 years trail Google's Pixel policy."

      "Design & Build": {
        "score": 9,
        "explanation": "Titanium frame reduces weight to 187g (-19g vs steel) with improved grip (GSMArena). IP68 rating maintained; Ceramic Shield front glass. Action Button replaces mute switch but placement debated."

      "Longevity Value": {
        "score": 8.5,
        "explanation": "Apple promises ~5 years of iOS updates; resale value remains high but repair costs noted ($199 back glass replacement). Base storage criticized at $999; Pixel rivals offer longer update commitments."
