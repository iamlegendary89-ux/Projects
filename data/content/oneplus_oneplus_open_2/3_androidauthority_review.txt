MobileOnePlus Open 2 rumors: Release date, leaked features, and everything else we know so farOnePlus hasn't confirmed the Open 2's existence, and you shouldn't expect it in 2025.By Aamir SiddiquiAndrew Grush•Published onFebruary 13, 2025•0•Aamir Siddiqui / Android Authority
Update: February 13, 2025 (3:15 PM ET): Despite several rumors of the device arriving this year, the manufacturer has now confirmed that the OnePlus Open 2 will not launch in 2025. However, OnePlus did not indicate that the successor to the OnePlus Open has been canceled.
Much of our original reporting below focused on the leaks regarding the OnePlus Open 2. In turn, many of these leakers may have been working on the assumption that the OnePlus Open 2 would be the global release name of the OPPO Find N5. We now know that the OnePlus Open 2 won't launch in the same year as the Find N5, and there's much less certainty that any such device would be based on the OPPO model, though it is still possible.
We will update this article as soon as we receive more reliable information about the prospect of a OnePlus Open 2.While Europe and parts of Asia have experienced a variety of excellent foldable phones, the US has had limited options beyond Samsung for years. Fortunately, this is no longer the case, as we now have several compelling alternatives from Google, Motorola, and, more recently, OnePlus. As we note in our OnePlus Open review, it is an outstanding product and feels much more polished than one might typically expect from a first-generation device. It’s not a perfect device, though, and there’s plenty of room for improvements, which we could get with the upcoming OnePlus Open 2. But are we even getting a successor? Here are all the leaks, rumors, and other details that we have about the OnePlus Open 2.OnePlus Open 2: At a glanceWhen is it expected to come out? If it launches, the OnePlus Open 2 will not be released before 2026.
What new features could there be? If it has specs similar to the Find N5, the OnePlus Open 2 could be slimmer and come with the latest flagship SoC, triple 50MP rear cameras, wireless charging, and more.
How much might it cost? There are no rumors about the OnePlus Open 2’s price yet, but it would likely be priced similar to or higher than the OnePlus Open’s launch price of $1,699 before trade-in discounts.Will there be a OnePlus Open 2?Aamir Siddiqui / Android AuthorityRumors in early 2024 suggested that OnePlus and OPPO could be backing away from foldables. However, the company has clarified that these rumors are baseless, and it remains committed to exploring foldables.Although OnePlus’ statements did not explicitly confirm the development of a product named the OnePlus Open 2, the continuation of their foldable line seems likely. The first-generation device received a generally positive reception, though it was criticized for its high price relative to other high-end foldables, especially given its lack of certain key features. The “Open” name suits the product well, so it’s unlikely that the branding will change in the near future.Note that the OPPO Find N3 was rebranded into the OnePlus Open when it launched. OnePlus is unlikely to abandon the branding, but rebranding from the OPPO Find N series in the Chinese market to the OnePlus Open series in the global market remains very much a possibility.The OnePlus post from February 13 indicated that the brand would not release a foldable in 2025, casting fresh doubt on the release of the OnePlus Open 2. However, we currently have no reason to think there will be a OnePlus Open 2 eventually.
What is the most likely OnePlus Open 2 release date?Ryan Haines / Android Authority
OnePlus Open — October 19, 2023The exact release date of the OnePlus Open 2 is difficult to predict, especially with only one model previously released. The original Open was available for pre-order on October 19, 2023, and began shipping on October 26. We’re past that timeline already, so the schedule was up in the air until the company chimed in.With regard to the OPPO Find N5, we’ve heard rumors of a Q1 2025 launch window for China and a global launch happening sometime after Chinese New Year. OPPO Chief Product Officer (CPO) and OnePlus founder, Liu Zuohu, confirmed that a launch is scheduled for February, so it seems Q1 was correct for China. However, if the Find N5 is ever rebranded as the OnePlus Open 2 for a global audience, it won’t be in 2025.As things stand, we have no information about when the OnePlus Open 2 could launch, but it won’t be any earlier than January 2026.
What rumored specs and features could the OnePlus Open 2 have?Dhruv Bhutani / Android AuthorityEditor’s Note: As per the update at the top of the article, the rumors and speculation in the following section may have been based on the assumption that the OnePlus Open 2 would be the rebranded OPPO Find N5. This is now looking less likely to be the case.The earliest rumors for the OnePlus Open 2 come from leaker Digital Chat Station, which claims that it will have an upgraded hinge to reduce weight, an “ultra-flat” folding screen, a 2K high-resolution cover screen, a thin design, Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 (which has been released as the Snapdragon 8 Elite already) and it could retain the periscope camera.Stressing on the thinness, Digital Chat Station mentions that the device would be 9.xmm thin, potentially marking it as thinner than the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold (10.5mm) and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 (12.1mm). In a later leak, DCS even went as far as to claim that the phone will be the “thinnest large foldable in the world.It’s not just DCS that’s harping on about the thinness, the company itself has even started to brag about it. OPPO’s Chief Product Officer, Liu Zuohu, went on Weibo to claim that the OnePlus Open 2 will be the “world’s thinnest folding flagship.” As if that wasn’t enough, OPPO Find series product manager Zhou Yibao also posted on Weibo, sharing a video of the Open 2 compared to various objects such as coins, sticky note pads, and card stacks.Aamir Siddiqui / Android AuthorityWhat makes this figure even more surprising is that rumors claim the device is betting on a big battery upgrade too. Digital Chat Station says the device could have a 6,000mAh battery, although a more recent leak revised the figure to 5,700mAh. Still, that would be a big step up from the Open’s 4,805mAh battery.Ryan Haines / Android AuthorityDigital Chat Station further states that the design of the OnePlus Open 2 could largely follow its predecessor’s. The device’s back will continue to sport a large round camera island, but the highlights for the Open 2 will be a triple 50MP rear camera setup with Hasselblad tuning. For reference, the OnePlus Open has a 48MP primary camera, a 64MP telephoto camera for 3x optical zoom, and a 48MP ultrawide camera. So, going up to 50MP for all three cameras gives us broad optimism for bigger and better sensors.The leak also suggests the OnePlus Open 2 could fix one of the biggest shortcomings of the Open. The Open 2 could come with wireless charging support, a feature that many users in the US consider a must in flagship devices. Leaker Smart Pikachu mentions that the OnePlus Open 2 could also support a magnetic accessory ecosystem. Further details have not been shared, but we presume that this will be enabled through cases with MagSafe-like rings, like the ones for the OnePlus 13.More detailed specs came from a report from Smartprix in December. The outlet claims that the main display LTPO, eight inches, has a 120Hz refresh rate, and offers 2K resolution. On the other hand, the external display is said to be 6.4 inches diagonally, which makes it a little bigger than before. Along with a Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, it will feature 16GB RAM and 1TB of internal storage. It seems we can also expect an IPX8 rating, 5,900mAh battery, 80W wired charging, and Oxygen OS 15. An OPPO executive also confirmed on January 21 that the device would offer 50W wireless charging and the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.On January 20, the company added that the Find N5/OnePlus Open 2 will have IPX8, IPX9, and IPX6 ratings. This means it should withstand hot water, high-pressure water jets, and immersion. However, there doesn’t appear to be dust resistance here.

Editor’s Note: As per the update at the top of the article, the rumors and speculation in the following section may have been based on the assumption that the OnePlus Open 2 would be the rebranded OPPO Find N5. This is now looking less likely to be the case.We know that OPPO and OnePlus are aiming to take the title of thinnest book-style foldable, but exactly how thin are we talking? There aren’t really any solid measurements at this point, we have only heard that it will supposedly be under 10mm in thickness. But the phone maker has started teasing the size in images and in a video.As mentioned earlier, OnePlus founder Liu Zuohu posted on Weibo to boast about the OnePlus Open 2. In that post is an image of an unfolded OnePlus Open 2 next to a sharpened pencil. It appears the handset is only a little thicker than the lead of the pencil when unfolded.OPPOShortly after that social post went up, product manager Zhou Yibao released the comparison video we mentioned before. From that video, we can tell the Open 2 is about as thick as four Chinese ID cards in its unfolded state.Both the image and the video only show off a small portion of the device, so we can’t really tell what the overall handset looks like. However, there have been a couple of leaked renders that have surfaced in the last few weeks.A report from Smartprix gives us two renders based on a final-stage prototype of the OnePlus Open 2. One of the images shows off the back of the device, while the second image offers a peek at the internal display.At first glance, the Open 2 looks a lot like its predecessor, but there are a few key differences here. First off, the foldable looks to be retaining the large circular rear camera housing, but the arrangement of the cameras is different. In the OnePlus Open, the camera lenses are located on the left side of the circular camera bump. Meanwhile, these renders show that the Open 2’s rear sensors are now in the top half of the circle, with the Hasselblad branding at the bottom.You may have also picked up on the fact that these renders show off a device with curved rear edges. This is unlike the flatter rear body of the first-gen foldable.
What might the OnePlus Open 2 price be?Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority
OnePlus Open (16GB / 512GB) — $1,699.99OnePlus has not shared anything about the OnePlus Open 2’s existence or its price, so we don’t know how much the upcoming foldable would cost.However, we can make some reasonable estimates based on past and current trends. The OnePlus Open launched at a price of $1,700, though OnePlus practically ran its promotional discount of $200 off by trading in any phone in any condition, effectively bringing the price down to $1,500. Trading in newer and functional devices would get you a better discount.One can safely presume that the company would at least price the OnePlus Open 2 as much as its predecessor and not sell it for cheaper. Given that the phone would likely come with the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, which is quite a bit more expensive than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 on the Open, users should brace themselves for a price increase in all likelihood.With these factors considered, we guess that the OnePlus Open 2 could cost anywhere between $1,700 to $2,000 at launch, with scope for promotional discounts.
Should you wait for the OnePlus Open 2?Aamir Siddiqui / Android AuthorityWe don’t know if and when the OnePlus Open 2 will launch, but we know it won’t be in 2025. As such, those in the market for a new foldable this year should not wait for the device.If you need a phone right away, you should choose from other foldables like the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold ($1799 at Amazon) or the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 ($1899.99 at Samsung). Even the OnePlus Open continues to hold its ground despite its relative age, though you should look for a discount to get the foldable for even cheaper.If you are open to more conventional Android flagships, then devices like the Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1099 at Amazon), OnePlus 13 ($899.99 at OnePlus), and Galaxy S25 Ultra ($1299.99 at Amazon) are good recommendations.
