Titanium, known for its strength and lightness, enables Apple to achieve a nearly 10% reduction in weight compared to the iPhone 14 Pro. The iPhone 15 Pro is 0.05 lbs lighter than its predecessor but still heavier than a Samsung Galaxy S23.
The phone's width and length have been decreased by 0.03 inches, though it is now around 0.02 inch thicker due to the camera module protruding more from the casing. The enclosure is beautifully constructed.
Notably, the iPhone 15 Pro features softer edges than its predecessor, enhancing its grip and comfort. The back panel, made of matte glass and adorned with a glossy Apple logo, exudes elegance. Additionally, Apple utilizes its Ceramic Shield on the front to protect the display against scratches and cracks. The entire phone is dust and water-resistant, complying with IP68 standards and IEC standard 60529, allowing it to be submerged in water up to 19.7 ft deep for 30 minutes.
In addition to white and black, the iPhone 15 Pro is available in Titanium Nature, a somewhat golden metallic tone. Our test gadget arrived in the fourth color option, a gleaming metallic blue.Size ComparisonXiaomi 13 Pro       Sony Xperia 5 V       Apple iPhone 14 Pro       Apple iPhone 15 Pro       Samsung Galaxy S23       DIN A6 ❌162.9 mm / 6.41 inch

Under EU pressure, Apple has included a USB-C connector in the 15th-generation iPhone. This change not only assures compatibility with a wide range of chargers but also mandates the use of an adapter for older accessories that use a Lightning connector. The new USB-C connector can transmit data at up to 10 GBit/s, bringing it in line with other high-end devices. Furthermore, HDR video output and resolutions up to 4K are now enabled, which is a big upgrade over the prior Lightning port's limits.
Although internal storage expansion via microSD remains unavailable, external storage devices can be connected through the iPhone's USB-C port.Left: SIM slot, volume buttons, action button

While Apple has historically provided updates for its iPhones for at least 5 years, the company does not make an official statement regarding the duration of updates.This approach reinforces Apple's closed ecosystem: many practical features work seamlessly when combined with other Apple devices. On a Windows PC, you can access photos or videos taken with your iPhone and synchronize media libraries or create backups via iTunes. However, the experience is much smoother on a Mac. Apps like iMessage and the new customizable caller appearance are exclusive to iPhones.
The latest version of Apple's operating system introduces numerous updates and new functions for both the operating system and included apps. For example, you can now share your estimated time of arrival at any location with other iPhone owners via location. If you arrive at or move away from the destination, notifications are sent accordingly.
The Health app now allows you to focus more on your mental well-being. In various parts of the phone, you are prompted to confirm if you want to view sensitive content such as nude pictures, or you can take a blurred preview to know what to expect.
Search criteria in the search function may now be combined for even more detailed queries. Visit Apple's website for a detailed list of all the advances.The USB-C port is compliant with DisplayPort specifications, enabling you to connect the iPhone 15 Pro to a monitor. There is currently no dedicated desktop mode; instead, the iPhone's screen is mirrored.Communication und GNSS – iPhone 15 Pro with 6 GHz WLANFinally, the iPhone 15 Pro is equipped with WiFi 6E, allowing it to access the less crowded 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi. Our test device achieves considerably higher speeds than the iPhone 14 Pro with WiFi 6 due to the absence of older devices causing interference in the frequency spectrum and the availability of additional 160 MHz channels. As a result, if the server allows it, the iPhone 15 Pro may fully use the speed potential of a gigabit Internet connection.
We achieved speeds of up to 1543 MBit/s during our tests using the Asus ROG Rapture AXE11000 as a reference router. The transfer rates remained consistently stable, always well above 1 GBit/s. Despite its metal casing, the iPhone maintains good reception thanks to antennas attached to the device's four narrow sides, appearing as thin strips. When close to the router, the iPhone achieves full signal strength, leading to almost immediate website loading; even images are nearly always available while scrolling. At a distance of 33 ft and through three walls, the reception decreases to 2/3, resulting in slightly slower page loading times.
The mobile modem featured in the iPhone 15 Pro is Qualcomm's Snapdragon X70, boasting a maximum download speed of 10 GBit/s. For the first time, it utilizes artificial intelligence to optimize both speed and reception quality within the 5G network. Theoretically, the iPhone 15 Pro supports all presently used 5G frequencies globally; however, mmWave technology remains exclusive to Apple customers in the US. Furthermore, the device offers extensive frequency coverage within the 4G range, enabling it to access mobile internet services worldwide.NetworkingApple iPhone 15 ProA17 Pro GPU, A17 Pro, 128 GB NVMe iperf3 transmit AXE11000 6GHz1449 (min: 1287) MBit/s ∼78%iperf3 receive AXE11000 6GHz1198 (min: 1116) MBit/s ∼73%Apple iPhone 14 ProA16 GPU 5-Core, A16, 256 GB NVMe iperf3 receive AXE11000723 (min: 365) MBit/s ∼44%iperf3 transmit AXE11000822 (min: 409) MBit/s ∼47%Xiaomi 13 ProAdreno 740, SD 8 Gen 2, 256 GB UFS 4.0 Flash iperf3 receive AXE11000809 (min: 780) MBit/s ∼49%iperf3 transmit AXE11000993 (min: 972) MBit/s ∼57%iperf3 transmit AXE11000 6GHz1859 (min: 919) MBit/s ∼100%iperf3 receive AXE11000 6GHz1637 (min: 1603) MBit/s ∼100%Sony Xperia 5 VAdreno 740, SD 8 Gen 2, 128 GB UFS 3.1 Flash iperf3 receive AXE11000838 (min: 818) MBit/s ∼51%iperf3 transmit AXE11000958 (min: 934) MBit/s ∼55%Samsung Galaxy S23Adreno 740, SD 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, 128 GB UFS 3.1 Flash iperf3 receive AXE110001659 (min: 1603) MBit/s ∼100%iperf3 transmit AXE110001749 (min: 1253) MBit/s ∼100%iperf3 transmit AXE11000 6GHz1799 (min: 1744) MBit/s ∼97%iperf3 receive AXE11000 6GHz1590 (min: 1562) MBit/s ∼97%Average of class Smartphone  iperf3 receive AXE11000636 (min: 34.8) MBit/s ∼38%iperf3 transmit AXE11000669 (min: 40.5) MBit/s ∼38%iperf3 transmit AXE11000 6GHz1510 (min: 229) MBit/s ∼81%iperf3 receive AXE11000 6GHz1368 (min: 598) MBit/s ∼84%0801602403204004805606407208008809601040112012001280136014401520TooltipApple iPhone 15 Pro; iperf3 transmit AXE11000 6GHz; iperf 3.1.3: Ø1449 (1287-1543) Apple iPhone 15 Pro; iperf3 receive AXE11000 6GHz; iperf 3.1.3: Ø1197 (1116-1235)GPS receptionThe iPhone's tracking module can accurately pinpoint our location within about 33 ft indoors and achieve an accuracy of 6.5 to 13 ft outdoors and supports all global satellite networks.
We tested the phone's tracking accuracy during a bike ride, comparing it with the Garmin Venu 2 smartwatch.
During testing, the iPhone 15 Pro performed admirably, even recording minor evasive movements. The recorded route deviated only when crossing a bridge over water. Overall, we highly recommend the Apple smartphone for demanding tracking tasks.Tracking Apple iPhone 15 Pro - Overview

The iPhone 15 Pro supports dual-SIM functionality, but it features only one nano-SIM slot. Consequently, users can use either a nano-SIM and an eSIM or two eSIMs.
We appreciate the excellent voice quality of the Apple smartphone. The other party's voice comes through clearly and distinctly. The microphone also captures our voice effectively. It might get slightly distorted if we speak too loudly, but it handles soft voices exceptionally well. When using the speaker and the hands-free microphone, the other person's voice is easily understood, and ours is relayed clearly. The background noise, however, is not always completely eliminated.Cameras - 3x optical zoom againRecording front camera
Portrait mode front cameraThe cameras remain the same as in the iPhone 14 Pro this year, with the addition of a LiDAR sensor on the rear.
The primary back camera still boasts a resolution of 48 megapixels and optical image stabilization. Apple introduced the new Photonic Engine, allowing the camera to capture images at full resolution and another at a reduced pixel count but optimized exposure. These images are then combined to create a 24-megapixel photo. Additionally, there's a new feature allowing for 48-megapixel HEIF shots, which can be instantly shared.
For enhanced versatility, the phone includes a wide-angle camera and a telephoto lens with optical zoom capability, providing users with a choice of three lenses. Similar to its predecessor, users can opt for a 3x optical zoom, extendable up to 15x through digital zoom. The camera allows seamless transitions between individual zoom levels in increments of 0.1.
The main camera's image quality impresses with its detailed shots and true-to-life color reproduction. Even challenging areas, such as cloudy skies in the surroundings, are displayed in intricate detail. Devices like the Honor Magic5 Pro have been seen to be able to gather a bit more details. The varying vibrancy of colors between photos from the two smartphone cameras is subjective and a matter of personal preference.
The optical zoom delivers excellent display performance, and even with the 15x digital zoom, the resulting images remain visible. The picture was captured from a distance of approximately 16 ft away from the fountain pipe.Wide angle shotWide-angle shots are well-lit and offer sufficient detail, although enlarging them too much is not recommended. They still perform well in very low light and high-contrast situations, capturing good pictures. The night mode automatically activates with a 2-second exposure time, which can be manually extended or shortened. While many details appear sharp with the system's selected setting, a bit more exposure in darker areas could enhance the overall quality.
For those who prefer more control, photos can also be taken in ProRAW format, allowing adjustments to factors like exposure after the shot. Apple provides several options in the video department, enabling users to record 4K videos at 24, 30, or 60 frames per second. In video mode, continuous zooming in and out, ranging from wide-angle to a 15x digital zoom, is possible during recording.Moreover, the iPhone 15 Pro now supports the Academy Color Encoding System, a global color standard for cinema productions. Additionally, it will receive an update in the future that includes the option for spatial video recordings, which can later be experienced with VR glasses.

A drawback: the provided cable supports only the USB 2.0 standard, making it unsuitable for tasks like connecting to a monitor.Thanks to the USB-C port, the iPhone now supports a wider range of chargers. Apple offers a compatible charger for $19 USD. Alternatively, users who prefer MagSafe charging can purchase a corresponding charger for $39 USD.
As for cases, options include a clear case or colored silicone cases available for $49 USD in the Apple Store. New additions are the FineWoven cases that mimic suede, priced at $59 USD.
Apple provides a standard 12-month warranty for iPhones.
Customers can opt for AppleCare+, an extended warranty service covering damages for two years, even if the standard warranty has expired or accidental damages occur. This additional service starts at ~$249 USD, with a deductible applied in case of repairs.Silicone case

While there isn't a fingerprint sensor for biometric unlocking, Face ID takes its place. This feature utilizes three-dimensional face recognition, making manipulation extremely challenging. The iPhone promptly and accurately recognizes a registered face.
In the past, iPhones had a unique alert slider allowing quick muting or volume adjustment for notifications and calls. This has now been replaced by the action button. While it can still be used to mute the phone by default, it also offers the flexibility to launch the camera or activate the flashlight. More complex actions can be set through shortcuts. Unfortunately, at the moment, only one option, specifically a long press, can be configured, as short presses or double-clicks cannot be customized.Keyboard: portrait mode
Keyboard: landscape modeDisplay – Bright OLED with great color reproductionSubpixel arrayThe 6.1-inch AMOLED screen on the iPhone 15 Pro is similar to the iPhone 14 Pro, and this is a positive indicator. The display was already impressively bright and offered accurate color reproduction.The iPhone 15 Pro's screen boasts a resolution of 2556 x 1179 pixels and achieves a peak brightness of approximately 1086 cd/m² in our tests using a spectrophotometer and CalMAN software. Notably, this brightness is observed when the entire screen is white; smaller surfaces exhibit even higher luminosity, with measurements exceeding 1900 cd/m² in HDR mode.
The screen can dynamically adjust its frame rate from 1-120 Hz, and save power when displaying static content, while scrolling in the web browser appears incredibly smooth at 120 Hz.At very low brightness levels, we detected 240 Hz PWM flickering. Although this frequency is quite smooth and generally shouldn't pose problems for most users, individuals sensitive to flickering screens should inspect the display closely before making a purchase.1084cd/m²1079cd/m²1089cd/m²1095cd/m²1092cd/m²1079cd/m²1083cd/m²1084cd/m²1088cd/m²Distribution of brightnesstested with X-Rite i1Pro 2Maximum: 1095 cd/m² (Nits) Average: 1085.9 cd/m² Minimum: 2.1 cd/m²Brightness Distribution: 99 %Center on Battery: 1092 cd/m²Contrast: ∞:1 (Black: 0 cd/m²)ΔE Color 0.91 | 0.5-29.43 Ø5.1ΔE Greyscale 1.3 | 0.57-98 Ø5.399.9% sRGB (Calman 2D)Gamma: 2.215Apple iPhone 15 ProSuper Retina XDR OLED, 2556x1179, 6.10Apple iPhone 14 ProSuper Retina XDR OLED, 2556x1179, 6.10Xiaomi 13 ProOLED, 3200x1440, 6.73Sony Xperia 5 VOLED, 2520x1080, 6.10Samsung Galaxy S23Dynamic AMOLED 2x, 2340x1080, 6.10Screen-22%-12%-33%-92%Brightness middle10921046 -4%1230 13%889 -19%1125 3%Brightness10861049 -3%1244 15%898 -17%1122 3%Brightness Distribution9998 -1%94 -5%97 -2%96 -3%Black Level *Colorchecker dE 2000 *0.911.2 -32%1 -10%1.4 -54%3.2 -252%Colorchecker dE 2000 max. *1.953.1 -59%2.8 -44%4.5 -131%4.9 -151%Greyscale dE 2000 *1.31.7 -31%1.8 -38%1 23%3.3 -154%Gamma2.215 99%2.19 100%2.24 98%2.23 99%1.97 112%CCT6481 100%6538 99%6446 101%6456 101%6504 100%* ... smaller is betterScreen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)ℹTo dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) .

We will delve deeper into this in the upcoming "Games" section.While the GPU clearly outperforms the 3DMark benchmarks, the Android competitors prove to be faster in the GFXBench tests. However, the iPhone consistently maintains a stable 60 fps in the demanding GFXBench Aztec Ruins at a resolution of 1,440p. This means that the GPU has enough power to run all mobile games at high detail, with performance reserves to spare.

Nonetheless, there are traditionally no comprehensive storage benchmarks available on iOS, leaving us to rely on our subjective observations.Exceptionally brief loading times and an incredibly responsive system advocate for Apple's storage solution. This is reinforced by the technical advantages it offers over UFS flash, including higher speeds during random reads and writes.Games - iPhone instead of a console?The high performance of the Apple A17 Pro is intended to be utilized for more than just casual mobile games like Candy Crush. Apple's objective is to enable the iPhone to handle substantial graphics-intensive games typically found on PCs or consoles.With the rise in popularity of mobile gaming for AAA titles, seen notably with devices like the Nintendo Switch and the Steam Deck, Apple is approaching this market. They have announced conversions of games such as Capcom's Resident Evil Village and Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage, set to launch at the end of October 2023. A notable feature is that all iPhone 15 Pro owners can test certain sections of these games for free as demos.During our tests, we explored games such as PUBG Mobile, Genshin Impact, and Diablo: Immortal. Unfortunately, we couldn't provide specific frame rates due to GameBench's software not yet supporting iOS 17. However, generally speaking, PUBG offers 60 fps in HD and 40 fps in UltraHD. Diablo: Immortal can be played at 60 fps in high resolution, and Genshin Impact even supports an impressive 120 fps.PUBG Mobile

No graph dataEmissions – Better control of waste heatTemperatureWe aimed to determine if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro encounters temperature-related issues and conducted a Linpack benchmark involving complex CPU calculations over an extended duration. We did observe a noticeable warming of the case, although it remained within acceptable limits at 109.76° F at room temperature.During prolonged load in the 3DMark stress tests, we recorded a maximum performance loss of 15%. Given the processor's high power level, this should hardly be noticeable in everyday use.

High frequencies, on the other hand, have a tendency to be overemphasized at times, resulting in an unpleasant rattle in the ears. Lowering the level slightly results in a more balanced sound, which improves voice clarity.
For wireless connections, the device utilizes Apple's AAC, meaning a high-resolution codec isn't available for Bluetooth connections on the iPhone.
Headphones and speakers can now be connected via USB-C, and Apple offers corresponding EarPods for $19 USD. However, users with older headphones may need a new accessory, as some third-party USB-C to 3.5 mm jack adapters may not be compatible. Apple provides a compatible cable for ~$10 USD.dB(A)

Charging the iPhone 15 Pro to full capacity takes approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. Opting for an 80% charge, beneficial for the battery's longevity, results in a quicker charging time.The iPhone 15 Pro supports wireless charging via MagSafe, reaching a maximum of 15 watts, and up to 7.5 watts through Qi. It also features reverse charging capabilities.Power Consumption

During tests with iOS 17.0.3, the Apple phone performs admirably and with minimal throttling.
The casing looks very chic and has successfully endured an initial durability test, unlike the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Thanks to IP certification and up to 20 ft of immersion depth, the phone can also be used in water.Nevertheless, in terms of everyday durability, the aluminum iPhone 15 is likely much more resilient.
Certainly, it's commendable that Apple has reduced the price of the iPhone 15 Pro compared to its predecessor.
Once more, there's a versatile camera system offering powerful shots, efficient optical zoom, and excellent image stability. Additionally, the iPhone 15 Pro now supports WiFi 6E, enabling significantly faster data rates and improved speed stability. While it's a positive move, it's worth noting that some other companies have already embraced WiFi 7 technology.
The flexible action button serves as a versatile alternative to the alert slider, and the vibrant 6.1-inch AMOLED display convinces with excellent image reproduction, although it's not entirely free from PWM flickering.The iPhone 15 Pro remains one of this year's top smartphones, offering exceptional performance and features within Apple's closed ecosystem.Choosing the iPhone 15 means forgoing the Always-On display, the new GPU, and the action button, and making compromises in the optical zoom. In return, opting for this choice results in a ~$265 USD saving. For those open to Android alternatives, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is worth considering, featuring a bright AMOLED screen and fast charging.Download your licensed rating image as SVG / PNGPrice & AvailabilityThe iPhone 15 Pro is currently only available for direct purchase from Apple, with a delivery date of mid-November, starting at $999 USD.Apple iPhone 15 Pro
