=========================

Verdict on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Even in its 15th generation, the small Galaxy phone has retained its virtues. The upper-class phone is compact and lightweight, feels very high-quality and features powerful hardware. Samsung's great update policy and its focus on sustainability in particular give it some unique selling points over the competition from China.
However, a look at the Vivo X200 Pro Mini or Xiaomi 15 shows what is possible in the area surrounding battery technology and makes the Galaxy S25's technically solid endurance and charging speeds seem a little meager. But the X200 Pro Mini in particular also outperforms the Samsung phone when it comes to cameras—and clearly so. Still, this isn't surprising, because any manufacturer who has been using the same sensor for its main camera for four generations is, simply put, lacking in innovation.

In general, the Galaxy S25 has the same problem as its predecessor. Although its overall package is attractive, its hardware offers hardly any advantages over the previous year's model—and on the software side, older Galaxy S phones will close the gap even more with their update to One UI 7 including the improved Galaxy AI.

With its 6.2-inch AMOLED display, the Galaxy S25 is the smallest model in the Galaxy S series. In contrast to its predecessor, not much has changed on the hardware side, with the biggest upgrade being its new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. The Qualcomm chipset, which has been specially adapted for Samsung, is said to offer advantages in the local acceleration of Galaxy AI and ProVisual Engine compared to the standard version of the SoC.
In the absence of much hardware innovation, Samsung is instead focusing on new AI features in its Galaxy S25. In this review, we'll be taking a look at where Galaxy AI has improved and what minor tweaks the successor to the Galaxy S24 has received.

Case - The Galaxy S25 is waterproofSamsung has stuck to its tried and tested design, only making minimal changes to the look of the Galaxy S25 compared to its predecessor. However, thanks to thinner bezels around its 6.2-inch OLED panel, the phone is slightly more compact. This is also reflected in its display-to-surface ratio of 91.1 percent, which is slightly more efficient and very good for a small smartphone. On the other hand, hardly anyone will notice its slight weight reduction of around 6 grams.

The Galaxy S25 is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, whereas Gorilla Armor or the current version Amor 2 is again reserved for the Ultra model. The Armor aluminum frame features a matte finish, as does the back of the device. The small S model is available in four standard colors again this year. In addition, there are three exclusive colorways that can only be bought from Samsung directly.
We have nothing to criticize about its build quality—the case has a very high-quality feel. Thanks to its IP68 certification, the Samsung phone is waterproof, so you can clean it under water with no problem.

Connectivity - The Samsung smartphone with image outputThe Galaxy S25 is available in three storage versions, namely with 128, 256 or 512 GB. While the small entry-level version still only supports the slower UFS 3.1 standard, the top-of-the-range models use UFS 4.0. Although, in our opinion, a size of 128 GB no longer seems up-to-date in this price range, Samsung has at least increased the RAM for all versions to 12 GB.
In addition to Bluetooth 5.4, Samsung Dex, NFC and Miracast, the Galaxy S25 features a fast USB 3.2 port (Gen 1) that supports USB OTG and wired image output. During our copying test with a connected M2.SSD hard disk, the USB port's transfer speeds reached a solid 190 MB/s. However, we were a little surprised to see that the successor to the Galaxy S24 has a reduced output voltage. This is why we couldn't use the Samsung 980 Pro in our test and had to rely on the more frugal Samsung PSSD T7.

Bottom case side (speaker, USB port, microphone, card slot)Software - The Galaxy phone with long update supportThe Galaxy S25 comes with Android 15 and the latest version of One UI. One of the strengths of the Galaxy S series is its long update support—and the S25 is no exception to this. The top-of-the-range phone is set to receive updates for a full seven years (until January 31, 2032). Security patches will be rolled out monthly in the first few years. During our test, the device's latest security patches were from March 1, 2025.
With the release of One UI version 7.0, Samsung is said to have improved its in-house Galaxy AI. Thanks to the new "AI Agents", the Galaxy S25 can interpret text, speech, images and videos, which should make interactions with the digital assistant feel more natural. There are also improvements to Google's "Circle to Search", a new "Now Bar" for personalized information on the phone's lock screen, and "AI Select", which is designed to anticipate the needs of users.

SustainabilitySamsung has provided detailed environmental data on the Galaxy S25 in its Product Environmental Report. According to the report, the top-of-the-range phone uses a variety of recycled raw materials such as gold, copper and aluminum. Its plastic and Gorilla Glass are also partly made from recycled materials.
In order to better assess the environmental impact of its products, the manufacturer specifies the carbon footprint for the entire life cycle of each model, including procurement, production, distribution and product use. In this case, the Galaxy S25 has a value of 45.7 kg CO2 eq.
In addition, the Samsung Galaxy S25's packaging is sustainable and doesn't use any plastics. Thanks to the availability of spare parts, self-repair kits and repair instructions, it is possible to repair the device yourself to some extent.Communication and GNSS - The Galaxy S25 of course with 5GThe Galaxy S25 supports a wide range of frequencies for all mobile communication standards, including 5G Sub6 and modern WiFi 7. However, its transfer rates with our reference router Asus ROG Rapture GT-AXE11000 still showed plenty of room for improvement in the 6 GHz WLAN range. The data rates we measured during transmission also weren't totally stable.

Location services indoors
Location services outdoorsThanks to dual-band GNSS support including all global satellite networks, the Samsung smartphone is capable of fast and accurate positioning. In order to check its location accuracy, we compared it with the Garmin Venu 2 on a short walk.
The Galaxy S25's results were great and, in some cases, more accurate than the Garmin smartwatch. This high location accuracy makes the Galaxy phone an excellent companion for users who value precise navigation.

Telephone functions and call quality - The Samsung smartphone with dual-eSIM support
The Galaxy S25 features dual-SIM support, giving users the choice between using two nano SIM cards, two eSIMs or a combination of both. Call functions such as VoLTE and Wi-Fi calls as well as AI-supported live translations are also on board.
The compact Galaxy phone's call quality is great, meaning callers can be clearly understood and voices are transmitted naturally. Background noise is filtered out reliably.Cameras - The Galaxy S25 without a sensor upgradeSelfie on the Galaxy S25 The Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23 feature almost the same cameras as the 2025 model. The lens on the front has an autofocus and a resolution of 12 MPix, and takes nice-looking selfies with a good level of sharpness in daylight.
The Galaxy S25's main camera once again comes fitted with the ISOCELL GN3. The 1/1.57 inch camera sensor, which has been used since the Galaxy S22, offers optical image stabilization and can use its full resolution of 50 MPix in Pro mode. It isn't clear to us why Samsung again hasn't opted for the much more modern ISOCELL GNK.0.6x1x2x3x6x10x30x (max)Photos taken on the 50 MPix camera show a strong dynamic range and natural colors, but the edges appear somewhat blurred. In low light, the contours are much softer than in daylight due to the rather small sensor, but they are still well-lit for a compact smartphone. A Vivo X200 Pro Mini with the Sony LYT-818 (1/1.28 inch) delivers much better photo quality, however.
The device's ultra-wide-angle lens, as well as its telephoto lens with OIS and triple lossless magnification, haven't changed compared to the Galaxy S24. The Galaxy S25's photos look reasonably sharp, but quickly appear noisy in poor lighting conditions.
Video can be recorded at a maximum of 8K at up to 30 fps. In UHD quality, you can select up to 60 fps. The stabilization during video recordings is good thanks to the camera's well-functioning OIS.

Accessories and warranty - The Samsung phone comes without a power supplyThe Galaxy S25 with a case from TorrasThe Galaxy S25 only comes with a USB-C cable and SIM tool. It doesn't have a screen protector installed straight out of the box. A matching Samsung power adapter as well as other accessories are optionally available in the manufacturer's online store. Third-party providers, such as Torras, also sell cases for the small Galaxy S phone, which are available on Amazon.
In the United States, the Galaxy S25 is covered by a standard 12-month warranty, which can be extended via the manufacturer's own Care+ insurance package. This costs between $8 and $349, depending on the coverage period and scope of insurance.Input devices and operation - The Samsung Galaxy S25 comes with FaceUnlockInputs on the phone's 6.2-inch OLED display are implemented accurately. Thanks to its compact design, the position of its buttons feels ergonomic and its fingerprint sensor is also positioned conveniently high up. This uses ultrasonic technology and unlocks the Galaxy S25 very quickly. Even with wet hands, the sensor in the OLED panel works reliably. Much less reliable 2D facial recognition using the front-facing camera is also available.
The power button not only serves as a classic on/off button, but it can also be assigned functions. Straight out of the box, the Galaxy S25 launches the Gemini voice assistant if you press and hold the control element long enough. Tapping the button twice opens the camera or an app that can be freely assigned by the user. The built-in linear vibration motor provides crisp haptic feedback and can be fully customized in the device's settings.

Display - The Samsung phone with AMOLEDThe OLED display is based on an RG/BG sub-pixel matrix consisting of one red, one blue and one green light-emitting diode eachThe Galaxy S25 uses a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which dynamically adjusts its frame rate from 1 Hz to 120 Hz using LTPO technology. Despite its 1080p resolution of 416 ppi, the screen looks nice and sharp. The panel itself is likely the same as in the Galaxy S24—at least our measurements suggest this.
The OLED display's light output is almost identical to its predecessor. While its brightness is "only" 1,311 cd/m² when showing a fully white display, we measured a powerful 2,594 cd/m² for the APL18 sample. When playing a 4K HDR pattern video, it even reached 2,766 cd/m².

As a result of the installed OLED technology, Samsung uses PWM modulation to control the phone's display brightness. The Galaxy S25's screen flickers constantly at 240 Hz, which isn't that high. Samsung doesn't use high-frequency PWM dimming so unfortunately, nothing has changed—in fact, we at least observed an increase to 480 Hz with increasing brightness in the predecessor model.
Even if the amplitude is comparatively flat when measured using an oscilloscope, people who are sensitive to PWM may still experience some discomfort.
Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)ℹTo dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) . This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.Screen flickering / PWM detected 240 HzAmplitude: 13.54 %The display backlight flickers at 240 Hz (worst case, e.g., utilizing PWM) . The frequency of 240 Hz is relatively low, so sensitive users will likely notice flickering and experience eyestrain at the stated brightness setting and below.In comparison: 53 % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8255 (minimum: 5 - maximum: 343500) Hz was measured.

The info box shows the enlarged version of the amplitude at minimum brightness).Even in version 7, the Samsung One UI only features two color profiles. If you want the most accurate display of colors and grayscale, then you'll have to select the color mode "Natural", which doesn't allow the user to make any adjustments, such as to the color temperature. Samsung should urgently make improvements in this respect.
We examined the AMOLED panel's color reproduction using the Calman analysis software and a photo spectrometer. The Galaxy S25's deviations weren't high overall, but the competition showed more accurate colors and grayscales.Color accuracy (profile: Natural, target color space: sRGB)

Gamers of fast-paced 3D titles should pay special attention to fast response times.   ↔    Response Time Black to White1.62 ms ... rise ↗ and fall ↘ combined↗ 0.8925 ms rise↘ 0.729 ms fallThe screen shows very fast response rates in our tests and should be very well suited for fast-paced gaming.In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.1 (minimum) to 240 (maximum) ms. » 8 % of all devices are better.This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (20.4 ms).   ↔    Response Time 50% Grey to 80% Grey2.64 ms ... rise ↗ and fall ↘ combined↗ 1.538 ms rise↘ 1.103 ms fallThe screen shows very fast response rates in our tests and should be very well suited for fast-paced gaming.In comparison, all tested devices range from 0.165 (minimum) to 636 (maximum) ms. » 10 % of all devices are better.This means that the measured response time is better than the average of all tested devices (31.9 ms).

The Galaxy S25 is well suited for outdoor use; even in direct sunlight, content always remains clearly visible. However, if you don't use the ambient light sensor, you'll have to make do with less brightness (414 cd/m²). The "Additional Brightness" option (740 cd/m²) only helped to a limited extent during our test. We have nothing to complain about in terms of the phone's viewing-angle stability.
Performance - The Galaxy S25 has a huge amount of powerUnlike last year, it's not just the Ultra model that uses a Qualcomm chip, but also the smaller Galaxy S25. The for Galaxy edition of the Snapdragon 8 Elite is advertised as having up to 40 percent higher CPU and GPU performance than its predecessor.
This increase in CPU power could also be observed when running our selection of benchmarks. In Geekbench 6, we noted an increase of around 34 percent in both its single and multi-core performance. With regards to its NPU unit, which was particularly important for the AI benchmarks, the Galaxy S25 sometimes achieved an even greater leap in performance. However, its increase in RAM to 12 GB LPDDR5x should also have had a positive effect here.

The device features the Adreno 830 graphics unit, which has a slightly higher maximum clock rate (1.2 GHz) in the Galaxy S25. During our GPU test, the Galaxy S25 was therefore often slightly ahead of a Xiaomi 15 with the standard version of the Qualcomm GPU. However, individual values were weaker, probably as a result of its heat development and pronounced throttling.

SpeakersThe Galaxy S25 uses a dual speaker system with subtle bass and present trebles, but Samsung's phone isn't capable of handling very low frequencies. Our Pink Noise measurement showed an increasing frequency curve for the mids and a slight dip in the super tweeters. Overall, however, its sound is very decent for a smartphone in the compact class.
Samsung is less generous when it comes to its Bluetooth audio codec support. Even so, it features an option for Auracast broadcast. Alternatively, music can be output via the USB-C port.

Battery life - The Samsung smartphone with Fast Wireless Charging 2.0Power consumptionWhen it comes to the phone's battery and its capacity, Samsung seems to be treading water. The same applies to its charging speed. The Galaxy S25 still has a 4,000 mAh battery, and wired charging is only supported at 25 watts. The Samsung phone can be charged wirelessly at a maximum of 15 watts. A full charge took around 70 minutes during our test with the Xiaomi 25000. 
At an average of around 1 watt, its power consumption in idle mode is on par with the competition, but the Qualcomm SoC draws significantly more power under load than a Xiaomi 15. This was also visible in its power consumption during Geekbench and GFXBench.

RuntimesThe slightly tight energy storage helps the Galaxy S25 achieve good battery runtimes, but a look at the competition from China reveals what endurance is possible in the compact smartphone class. Since the Galaxy phone overheated in the Burnout benchmark, we ran the load test under simplified conditions (CPU only).

Editor of the original article: Marcus Herbrich - Senior Tech Writer - 555 articles published on Notebookcheck since 2016I have always been very passionately interested in mobile technologies, especially smartphones. Being a tech enthusiast means the half-life of my devices isn’t exactly long, and being the latest hardware is not enough to suffice as the manufacturer and operating system play a minor role – the most important aspect for me is that the device is state-of-the-art. After posting for Mobi Test I joined Notebookcheck in 2016, where I have been pursuing my enthusiasm for technology by reviewing the latest smartphone, tablet, and accessory trends.contact me via:

@Marcus_HerbrichTranslator: Daisy Dickson - Translator - 460 articles published on Notebookcheck since 2023Originally from Scotland, I grew up and lived in Germany until I completed my high school qualifications before moving back to Scotland to complete my university studies. Growing up bilingual led me to form a close relationship with the English and German languages, often working in the fields of teaching and translation. Most of my childhood was shaped by playing around on new consoles, computers and gadgets and getting to grips with the new craze of the internet and smartphones. This interest has stayed with me well into adulthood. Nowadays, I live in Glasgow and work as a freelance translator and digital media coordinator. I have been translating for Notebookcheck since early 2023.
