IntroductionOppo's Find X8 Ultra was a widely anticipated smartphone, and it is finally here! It is one of the few Ultra models on the market truly worthy of the moniker - it has an Elite chipset, a QHD screen, super-fast charging, and a proper Ultra-grade camera kit, of course.Let's start from the beginning. Compared to the Find X7 Ultra, the new model has a more powerful chipset, a larger battery, and improved camera sensors and lenses. Let's not forget the refreshed design, too.Find X8 Ultra vs. Find X7 UltraOr, compared to the Find X8 Pro, the Ultra brings a larger and higher-res screen, more powerful silicon, an upgraded camera setup with larger sensors, and faster wired charging.The Find X8 Ultra's 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED has a 1440p resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support. It runs on the most powerful chipset on the market - the Snapdragon 8 Elite, coupled with LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.0 storage.The Ultra model packs a larger 6,100mAh battery capable of 100W wired, 50W wireless, and 10W reverse wireless charging.The real showstopper on the Find X8 Ultra is the camera system, of course. There are still four 50MP cameras on its back with two telephoto modules. The main camera is familiar - a 23mm f/1.8 unit with the same 50MP 1-inch Sony LYT-900 used in last year's Find Ultra. It is the largest a cameraphone can employ these days.The two periscope cameras have been upgraded, though. The shorter 3x module has a LYT-700 1/1.56-inch 50MP sensor with a 70mm lens and a bright f/2.1 aperture. It can focus from as close as 10cm away! Then comes the 6x 135mm telephoto camera with a large 1/1.95-inch LYT-600 sensor and a bright f/3.1 aperture (compared to f/4.3 on the Find X7 Ultra and Find X8 Pro).The last 50MP camera is a bit of a downgrade compared to the Find X7 Ultra - a 1/2.75-inch Samsung JN5 sensor with a 15mm f/2.0 autofocus lens. The Find X7 Ultra had a larger sensor and a 14mm lens.Camera galoreThe rear setup also features what Oppo calls a True Chroma Camera, which is a 9-channel multispectral system for more accurate white balance and color temperature mapping across the photo.Finally, the selfie camera is lifted straight from the Find X7 Ultra - it is the same 21mm f/2.4 autofocusing camera with the 32MP LYT506 1/2.74-inch sensor.What's a camera without behind-the-scenes working magic, right? Oppo's next-gen HyperTone Image Engine comes to help with improved computational abilities and performance under demanding light. There's AI tone mapping for better depth and detail, and the ProXDR engine for enhanced brightness and color information.The Find X8 Ultra boots Android 15 with ColorOS 15.Oppo Find X8 Ultra specs at a glance:Body: 163.1x76.8x8.8mm, 226g; glass front, glass back, aluminum frame; IP68/IP69 dust tight and water resistant (high pressure water jets; immersible up to 1.5m for 30 min).
