Introduction

It is once again September - and with it comes the new best iPhone ever. The Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max brings a brand-new aluminum body, improved performance and heat dissipation, better selfie and telephoto cameras, a larger battery with faster charging, and is the most comfortable home to the new iOS 26 with Liquid Glass interface.

The latest generation brought a major change - Apple dropped the Plus model in favor of the ultra-thin Air, and now all iPhones have ProMotion screens, a long, long overdue upgrade.

It was about time Apple stopped with the iterative updates and shook things up. And one thing is certain - nothing will be the same as before, for better or worse.

The 17 series see the Pro models switch to an aluminum unibody for the first time, helping keep weight in check and improving heat dissipation. While this was done for practical reasons, the years of hyping steel and titanium may come to bite Apple.

The usual chip and connectivity updates are here courtesy of the Apple A19 Pro SoC, the base memory has been upped to 256 GB for the rest of the lineup, while the Pro Max which was already there last year gains a new 2 TB storage option. The battery life got better, the charging got faster, and iOS got more features.

The two major camera upgrades include a new 18MP Center Stage selfie camera with a square (not quite, but we'll get to that later) sensor and multi-aspect shooting, and a new 48 MP telephoto camera with 4x optical zoom. Oh, and you can now capture 4K120 Dolby Vision clips.

The new signature color is Cosmic orange, which will be familiar to the veterans in the industry from the Nokia N8. Fun fact: that one used anodized aluminum much like the iPhone Pros of this year.

A smaller notch would have been on many people's wishlist, but we guess Apple is not ready to rethink the whole Dynamic Island thing just yet.

Unboxing the Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max

The iPhone 17 Pro Max ships in a super thin paper box that has the phone's back side printed on the cover.

The contents can be referred to as a traditionally Apple, new owners getting braided USB-C cable and a SIM ejection pin if you have a physical SIM slot. That's it.

There is a new charger that was made with the iPhone 17 models in mind, a product that can easily win the worst name of the year award - the 40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max adapter. We think it should have been a standard bundle for the first iPhone to adopt the AVS charging protocol, but Apple chose to sell it separately, trying to squeeze an extra $39 from those looking to take advantage of the newly improved charging speed.

Design, build quality, handling

Welcome (back) to the aluminum iPhone era. No more titanium, no more steel. Apple finally decided to take a step back for the Pro models, opting for the more practical solution even if it risks being accused of cheaping out. Because aluminum may be good for the iPhone, but it's far from exclusive as titanium.

Along with the new frame material comes a major change to the design of the back, and it's a controversial one. There is a huge rectangular camera housing, there is aluminum, and then there is a glass piece that covers the wireless charging coil. The mix of different elements is a far cry from the usual seamless design Apple products have been known for. Worse yet, there are uneven gaps between the glass cover and the aluminum that you can see with the naked eye.

Having an aluminum frame and sticking out camera housing raises another issue - scratches. One drop is enough to deform the frame and destroy the water resistance, or worse. Carrying your iPhone without a case risks getting its camera island scratched fairly quickly - an unfortunate reality that early adopters discovered. Aluminum is much softer than even titanium, let alone steel, so it's good to keep that in mind.

On the upside the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a Ceramic Shield 2 glass at the front with anti-reflective coating for incredible legibility even in the most challenging conditions. Then there is the matte aluminum chassis spreading from the frame, towards the back and up to the camera housing in a subtle volcano-like fashion. Finally, there is the first-gen Ceramic Shield glass on the back that sits atop the wireless charging coil.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is IP68-rated for dust and water resistance, but Apple has enhanced it further to survive for 30min in up to 6m deep water.

The exterior changes are mostly on the back with the full-width camera island and the window-like glass piece. The sides are more curved than before, reminiscent of the long-gone iPhone 6 times.

Oh, and there are new colors to enjoy this year - the signature Cosmic Orange, the safe bet Deep Blue, and universally-appealing Silver.

The Orange and Blue options have the same color across the entire body - both at the aluminum and the rear glass. The silver model though has silver aluminum and white glass. The difference in the hues is obvious, and it makes the gap between the glass and the metal parts more prominent.

While Apple chose Cosmic Orange as its hero color, Deep Blue may well be the best of the new colorways to get for its matching parts and more traditional iPhone looks. Orange is a flashier option, looking a bit retro, but that might be the exact reason some will go for it. Silver is a mixed bag, but it wins points for being the signature Apple color for various devices over the years.

One thing is certain with the new iPhone 17 Pro Max - it doesn't look like any previous iPhone, which is arguably a good thing as nobody likes getting the same old thing over and over again. However it doesn't carry over the meticulous attention to detail Apple is famous for.

The front packs the 6.9-inch LTPO Super Retina XDR OLED screen with nicely thin bezels. The screen has an i-shaped perforation that iOS expands into a pill and then leverages it for the so-called Dynamic Island. The size of the pill hasn't changed since its introduction, but it looks smaller on the Max thanks to its larger display.

The pill has the new 18MP selfie camera on the left and the 3D ToF array for the Face ID on the right.

Above the screen is a thin earpiece that doubles as the second speaker in the stereo setup.

The back has a full-width camera island that houses the three 48 MP cameras (main, ultrawide, telephoto), the LiDAR scanner, the LED flash, and a microphone.

The glass part of the back covers the MagSafe magnets and the wireless charging coil.

The aluminum frame has a comfortably rounded edge. The top part is empty, while the bottom has the USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, the primary microphone and the other speaker.

The left has the volume and Action keys, and if you get a physical SIM-enabled iPhone, the SIM slot would be here, too.

Finally, the Side and Camera keys are on the right. There is no change to the Camera key - it is both clickable and capacitive-touch sensitive.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max measures 163.4 x 78 x 8.8mm and weighs 233 grams. This is roughly the same size as the 16 Pro Max, just a hair thicker and 5g heavier. Despite the swap to the aluminum, the new heat dissipating films and elements, the new chip, the larger battery, and the new cameras have not only compensated, but actually led to an increase in the total weight.

Still, the iPhone 17 Pro Max feels absolutely lovely in hand, with a nice heft to it, and good balance with an even weight distribution. The overall grip level is unimpressive though - certainly better than the iPhones with the polished frame, but not an improvement over the 16 Pro Max.

We do feel a part of the premium look and feel is lost, replaced with a more practical design with different pieces thrown in together, visible gaps, and perhaps not the most universally loved colorways. The drop and scratch resistance have been heavily compromised because of the aluminum, too, although we can't image what the weight would have been with a steel frame.

Display

The iPhone 17 Pro Max packs a 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen with ProMotion tech (a term Apple uses to describe variable 120Hz refresh rate). The panel hasn't changed much since the iPhone 16 Pro Max - it has the same resolution of 1320 x 2868 pixels or 460ppi, and the same pill-shaped cutout.

The screen is protected by a new Ceramic Shield Glass 2 with anti-reflective coating - not only we get an even more shatter-proof glass, but the overall legibility under bright light has improved. The difference in the reflectivity between the 16 Pro Max and the 17 Pro Max is not jaw-dropping, but it is noticeable.

The screen dynamically switches from 1Hz to 120Hz, supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision content, and True Tone adjustments for the color temperature depending on the light around the phone.

Apple advertises the display as capable of 1 nit of minimal, 1,000 nits of maximum manual, up to 1,600 nits of peak HDR, and up to 3,000 nits of maximum automatic (outdoor) brightness.

Our measurements confirm these numbers, sort of. We indeed got the screen down to 1 nit of brightness on white color.

Then we measured 804 nits of maximum manual and exactly 1,000 nits of maximum automatic brightness with our usual test patches.

Finally, we measured the peak brightness at a 15% white square (that is to say 15% of the screen are lit up) - 2,652 nits. It will reach 3,000 nits on an even smaller patch for sure. But if we go from 15% white square to 75%, we saw the display keep over 1,600 nits for a couple of seconds before going down to 1,000 nits.

Our take on those readings is the display is very much capable of reaching high brightness when needed, just not when you command it to. Its sunlight legibility, for example, is excellent thanks to the new antireflective coating and properly bright screen. The loss of color is quite minimal.

With ProMotion you get no control over the refresh rate. It is a dynamic one, and it drops down to 1Hz for static pictures and always-on/standby modes.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision and it is recognized by all known apps as such. Apple does its HDR video playback in a very flexible way since it's not necessary for the content to be displayed fullscreen for HDR to work. It can just work on the portion of the display that has the video playing, which is a bit of a surreal experience the first time you encounter it.

There are a handful of smartphones that deserve praise for their haptics, and the iPhones are certainly among them. The Taptic engine provides accurate and pleasant feedback, and we loved it.

Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max battery life

The iPhone 17 Pro Max got a minor battery capacity bump to 4,832mA if you're in one of those regions that gets a version with a physical SIM slot like we do. The eSIM-only variants have a bit more, at 5,088mAh. It's not a huge increase from the 4,685mAh powerpack of the 16 Pro Max, but we'll take what we can get.

The phone does a pretty impressive job with that battery, it has to be said, returning class-leading results across the board (well, at least in the screen-on tests which is what really matters). We clocked just over 12 hours of gaming, 15 and a half hours of web browsing and about 25 and a half hours of video playback. Sure, the call time is merely alright, but who gets a Pro Max for that?

With all the numbers crunched, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's Active Use Score stands at 17:58h - how about that, Pixel?

Our new Active Use Score is an estimate of how long the battery will last if you use the device with a mix of all four test activities. You can adjust the calculation based on your usage pattern using the sliders below. You can read about our current battery life testing procedure here. For a comprehensive list of all tested devices so far, head this way.

Charging speed

The iPhone 17s finally bring some improvements to charging speed, ushering in a new charging standard. Or, rather, it's popularizing a fairly recent addition to the USB Power Delivery spec, called AVS. Apple makes one adapter that explicitly adheres to that specific part of the protocol, the brand new and wonderfully named '40W Dynamic Power Adapter with 60W Max', which is only available in North America for the time being, so we couldn't get one. Google's pretty recent 'Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W USB-C Fast Charger' also explicitly states AVS on the tin and we just got a hold of that one, so we tested with it.

Apple promises the Pro Max will get to 50% in 20 minutes when using its new adapter, though it does allow the possibility that other adapters might achieve the same feat "Up to 50% charge in 20 minutes with 40W adapter or higher (available separately) paired with USB-C charging cable", the official specs say.

Well, in our test with the Pixel adapter, we got to 47% in 20 minutes, which is sort of close enough, but also not quite. A charge from 1% to 100% took us 1:12h. The phone and charger agreed on a 15V/3A 45W current and our meter maxed out at 35W while the battery was still close to empty, gradually decreasing, as expected.

The thing is, though, that same protocol that the two shook hands on, we also achieved with a wide selection of aftermarket and other phone makers' own adapters and we did measure essentially the same peak power values. We also clocked a full charge cycle with the Samsung 45W adapter and that turned out marginally slower (63% at 30 minutes, 1:17 to full), though it could just be a run-to-run variation more than a real difference. We are doing our best to get our hands on one of those 'special' Apple adapters, but we're not really expecting miracles.

Speakers

The iPhone 17 Pro Max has a hybrid stereo setup with a full-fledged bottom speaker and the earpiece pulling a double duty.

The pair sounds incredibly well in real life, balanced and boomy.

The speakers scored a Good mark on our loudness test, a step back from the previous model. We couldn't hear the difference in real life, but obviously there is one.

The sound quality has changed a bit, too, though we can still rate it is a Very Good. Apple tweaked the speakers so they can offer good bass and treble, the vocals could use a small boost, too.

Use the Playback controls to listen to the phone sample recordings (best use headphones). We measure the average loudness of the speakers in LUFS. A lower absolute value means a louder sound. A look at the frequency response chart will tell you how far off the ideal "0db" flat line is the reproduction of the bass, treble, and mid frequencies. You can add more phones to compare how they differ. The scores and ratings are not comparable with our older loudspeaker test. Learn more about how we test here.

Apple iOS 26

All iPhone 17 models, as well as the Air, boot Apple iOS 26 out of the box, and it has already been seeded to older iPhones all the way back to the iPhone 11.

The version jump is certainly unusual - it has gone from iOS 18 to 26, matching the (fiscal) year as Apple decided to switch to a unified naming scheme for its portfolio of operating systems.

The biggest change to iOS 26 is Liquid Glass - Apple's new design language. It's clearly inspired by visionOS and Apple says it "makes something purely digital feel natural and alive." The entire UI features crystal-like (or liquified) design elements and a more dynamic touch response.

In addition to the new customizable UI, together with fonts, animations and colors, many system apps have been updated, too. Photos, Phone and Contacts, Messages, Camera, Safari, Wallet, Maps, plus services like Apple Intelligence, Games, CarPlay - they were all updated with new look and features.

Lockscreen

Always-on and Standby always-on (when charging) options are available to all new iPhones. The Lock screen is updated with Liquid Glass and is now more customizable. The time widget is easily resizable, and it can adapt to the main subject of your photos and the number of incoming notifications. Apple also added new spatial scenes, which bring a 3D effect to your wallpapers.

The lockscreen on iOS 26 follows a familiar logic - it's one with the Notification Center and houses your notifications, plus shortcuts for the torch and the camera.

Every widget, shortcut and wallpaper can be customized in various different ways, and you can make the whole thing really yours.

Lockscreen

Homescreen, notifications and Action center

Beyond the lockscreen, the iOS interface is still based on homescreens populated with apps and widgets. You have the App Library (app drawer) for your less important apps and Notification and Control Centers. There is also a Spotlight search page.

iOS 26 homescreens

Your apps usually populate the homescreen(s) and widgets. There are two specific screens - the leftmost is the Today page, while the rightmost page - App Library.

You can hide specific homescreens - you may have a page that's full of games and hide it when at work or hide a page of work/school apps when on vacation. You can't opt out of Today and App Library, though.

The homescreen supports icon customization - you can enlarge the app icons and hide their names, choose an accent color for all icons, switch between light and dark themes, and there is a new monochrome look with liquefied opacity option.

Icon customization

The widgets have seen visual updates and they can be stacked as before.

Widgets

The Notification Center is summoned with a swipe from the left top corner or the pill itself. The pane was unified with the lockscreen in iOS 11, and that's why you can have different wallpapers on your homescreen and notification center.

The Control Center supports multiple pages and offers a ton of different toggles and widgets. Some of the toggles are expandable, as before.

Notifications • Controls • Task Switcher

The Task Switcher hasn't seen any updates - you see app cards and swipe them for closure. You can also swipe on the gesture line to quickly switch between apps.

Finally, the Dynamic Island is unchanged. It is still an enlarged black pill that allows for a more convenient multi-tasking when using timers, music players, phone app, Focus modes, etc.

System apps

The Photos app is updated with the new visual identity and gets Library and Collections tabs. Any 2D photo can be transformed into a 3D Spatial Scene.

Photos

Safari brings a smaller, adaptable tab bar, which blends into the page as you scroll and dynamically shrinks so you see more of the page.

Safari

FaceTime has a new landing page with personalized contact posters and video messages from your contacts.

The Phone app gets a favorites tab with recent contacts and voicemail listed below. Apple is bringing voicemail summaries to help you save time. The contacts and keypad are still accessible below.

Phone

Call Screening will fight spam calls coming from unknown numbers in the background. If you receive a call from an unknown number, your iPhone will only begin to ring after the person on the other end provides their name and reason for calling.

Hold Assist can help keep your spot during calls when waiting in line for phone support and will notify you when you've reached a real person on the other line.

Messages gets new backgrounds for chats, you can even use AI-generated ones. Group chats get polls, Apple Cash inside the chat and typing indicators. The screening tools from the Phone app are also here with on-device spam detection.

Live Translation is Apple's overhauled translation app, powered by Apple Intelligence. It is integrated into the Messages, Phone and FaceTime apps. You can use the feature during calls and also get translated captions during FaceTime video chats.

The TV app is part of iOS 26, and it is your default video player for locally stored movies and shows you've added via iTunes. This is also the digital store for movies and TV shows, and the place where you find the Apple TV+ streaming service. A bit overwhelming, but you get used to it eventually.

TV

Music is the default audio player, and it integrates Apple Music. But even if you decide not to use the streaming service, it can still do an excellent job if you have a few spare minutes to add your songs via iTunes.

Apple Music

Apple Music gets lyrics translations and pronunciation guides as well as 3D album artwork animations on your lock screen. AutoMix helps create mixes and automatically adds transitions between songs. Music Pins allows you to pin favorite songs, artists and genres.

The Wallet app gets a new boarding pass interface with maps for popular airports. You can also share your flight status and Find My trackers.

Apple Maps can now learn your preferred routes and will adapt to your commutes to improve your trips. Apple is also bringing Visited Places to help you remember restaurants and other locations you've visited recently.

Apple Wallet flight status • Apple Maps

CarPlay is also in on the Liquid Glass redesign as it extends its way into the car. You get light and dark modes and new compact alerts for incoming calls, messages and other notifications. Apple is also bringing widgets to the CarPlay UI and Live Activities. The same widgets made for iPhones will work on the new CarPlay.

CarPlay in iOS 26

iOS 26 brings a new Games app. It's an all-in-one destination for games, exploring new titles and connecting with friends. The app features Home, Arcade, Play Together, and Library tabs. Gamers can find upcoming events, new updates and can jump into their favorite games straight from the app.

Games app

Apple Intelligence

Apple Intelligence is now available to most of the world, Europe included. And Apple is adding an alternative to Google's excellent Circle to Search to its core feature set.

Visual Intelligence

Visual Intelligence lets you search for anything on your screen, much like Google's implementation. However Apple's method takes a few more steps as you take a screenshot, then see the new Ask tool and Image search button. From there, you can highlight the item you want to search and it will pop up on Google or any other app you use to search and shop. Visual Intelligence can also extract text from event invitations and features ChatGPT integration.

Camera

The Camera app is another one to get the Liquid Glass redesign. The UI is now round, and a swipe brings up all settings. More importantly all the photo and video quality options are finally available in one place!

iOS 26 Camera app

Wrap-up

Apple iOS 26 is one of the largest overhauls the Apple's smartphone OS has seen recently, the new Liquid Design language really refreshing its look.

We appreciate all new features added throughout the whole system, including the Visual Intelligence, Call Screening, Game services, improved Camera app, and highly customizable home and lock screens.

But we are not sure that Apple has stuck the landing with the Liquid design itself. It brings a sort of retro look and vibe, makes a mess out of some elements, and causes inconveniences in certain parts as everything seems somewhat chaotic. There is a lot of room for improvement with buttons and elements that need to be rethought or at least re-positioned.

The once famous for its cleanliness and symmetry iOS has turned into an animated concoction that is seemingly falling behind. And while we appreciate Apple looking to change the look, it will need to work hard to polish the great number of rough edges the new version introduces.

Most notable of those is the lack of core features. There is no improvement in file management - either within iOS, or via a computer. It is still a nightmare to manage files. But hey, now you can assign an MP3 file to be your ringtone, provided it's 30s long. This sounds like it's coming from the year 2015.

Apple is also falling behind in the AI race, and while it's investing heavily to catch up we are yet to see any meaningful steps forward.

Obviously, people familiar with iOS and used to its shortcomings will not find much wrong with version 26. It remains a stable OS, if dated on the feature side.

Performance and benchmarks

The iPhone 17 Pro Max is powered by the new 3nm Apple A19 Pro chipset, which is the most capable of the current generation. It's a step above the A19 in the base model iPhone 17, and, confusingly, above the A19 Pro inside the iPhone Air.

On the iPhone 17 Pro models, the A19 Pro SoC packs a 6-core CPU (2 performance clocked at 4.26GHz and 4 efficiency cores ticking at 2.6GHz) and a 6-core GPU with one more core than the Air's A19 Pro and support for hardware-accelerated Ray Tracing.

A 16-core Neural Engine boosts performance of Apple Intelligence tasks. The iPhone 17 Pros got a new vapor chamber plate that alongside the aluminum body, should finally improve cooling and, in turn, sustained performance.

Apple says the proprietary alloy it uses is a big improvement over the Titanium of the previous generation iPhone Pros, and the overall cooling enables 40% better performance when under prolonged stress.

Both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max use the N1 Apple-designed networking chip, with support for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread.

The new iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max pack 12 GB of LPDDR5X 8533 RAM, up from 8 GB LPDDR5X 7500 RAM on the outgoing Pro Max. The base storage is 256 GB NVMe, and you can opt for 512 GB and 1 TB on both Pro models. There is also a 2 TB option exclusive to the Pro Max.

The iPhone 17 Pro models offer tri-band Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, support Bluetooth 6.0, and Ultra Wideband via Gen 2 chip. Also worth noting is the USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, which supports up to 10Gbps transfer speeds, DisplayPort and USB Host mode.

And now, let's see some benchmarks! The single-core CPU performance is up 10% compared to the 16 Pro Max's A18 Pro chip, while the multi-core is gains 20%. The performance gap between the A19 Pro CPU and the A17 Pro CPU is quite large, so it seems updating from the 2-year old iPhone 15 Pro models makes sense.

The AnTuTu scores of the 17 Pro Max is even more impressive with a compound score that is miles ahead of the iPhone 15 Pro Max and a lot better than the 16 Pro Max.

The new iPhone 17 Pro Max kept 65% of its processor performance on our stress test (APSI Bench) and 53% of its graphics performance (on 3D Mark WildLife Extreme).

CPU test • GPU test

We ran the same tests on the iPhone 16 Pro Max and we got 77% for CPU and 65% for GPU. Granted the Apple A19 Pro is a more powerful piece of hardware, so even when throttled to these levels, it should provide more oomph than the throttled A18 Pro. But we are certainly not seeing the 40% imrpovement promised by Apple.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max did get quite hot after continuous stress tests, quite unpleasant to touch at times.

The Apple A19 Pro is one of the most powerful chipsets on the market, that is for sure. It provides incredible performance across the board and is a massive upgrade over the iPhone 15 Pro Max and its A17 Pro. Its stability is quite good, too, for a phone with passive cooling solution.

But Apple has tried to convince us the switch to aluminum will make this iPhone offer better stability and the last year models and that's just not case.

New telephoto on the back, square selfie sensor (kind of)

Major camera hardware upgrades from one generation to the next have almost become unthinkable lately, but what we're seeing on the iPhone 17 Pro Max (and the small Pro) can just about qualify. A new telephoto makes all rear cameras equal in resolution while dialing back the reach a bit makes for better mid-range performance. And an entirely new selfie camera on the front is done in a way that we haven't seen before.

The new telephoto employs a 48 MP 1/2.55" sensor, the same nominal resolution and size as the one on the ultrawide camera. It's paired with a tetraprism lens with a 100mm equivalent focal length and an f/2.8 aperture. Apple prefers to stabilize the sensor instead of the lens, and you're getting sensor-shift stabilization here - like on the previous-gen telephoto and some five previous generations of main cameras.

So in summary, the new telephoto gives you a larger and higher-res sensor than the previous one (12 MP, 1/3.06") but sacrifices a little bit of zoom reach - it's 4x optical zoom on the 17 Pro Max vs. the 5x on the 16 Pro Max. However, that 48 MP new sensor might have potential to be significantly better than the old one beyond their optical zoom levels - Apple is confident enough in its capabilities to offer an 8x shortcut in the viewfinder. We'll see about that.

The ultrawide camera is the same as last year, and so too is the main unit. Both use 48 MP sensors, and the one on the main camera is pretty big, with a 1/1.28" optical format. The main camera is also sensor-shift-stabilized.

All three rear cameras now offer 24 MP shooting capability - up until now it was only on the main camera. All three can also shoot in 48 MP too.

Apple's new 18MP selfie camera is a star attraction that makes a debut across the entire lineup (as is more or less the norm with iPhone selfie cameras). It is an interesting concept for at least a couple of reasons, not the least of which is the octagonal shape of the sensor.

Yes, it's not really a square, like you would expect from watching the product keynote, but the corners have been shaved off. We aren't sure exactly why, but it does make sense from a practical standpoint since regardless of the selfie photo orientation, the corners are never getting used. All the while, this might be saving some valuable wafer space in production - enough to warrant what has to be an entirely custom and more difficult to produce imager.

And that's the other thing, the new sensor is what we would call "multi-aspect". It is meant to capture selfies in around 18MP resolution in a 4:3 aspect ratio in either portrait or landscape orientation - with the same diagonal field of view. Those shots come out at 4,892x3,672px, but if you want a 1:1 image, you'd get a center crop from the sensor, at 13.5MP.

That is, unless you have the resolution set in the phone (as opposed to the camera app) settings at 12 MP, in which case you'd be looking at 12MP 4:3 shots and 9 MP in 1:1 aspect - that's rather maniacal and you don't get a resolution indicator in the selfie viewfinder like you do for the rear cameras.

Anyways, the selfie camera has PDAF. It uses a 20mm f/1.9 lens with OIS.

Wide (main): 48MP Sony IMX 903 (1/1.28", 1.22µm-2.44µm), f/1.78, 24mm, dual-pixel PDAF, sensor-shift IS; 4K@120

Ultrawide: 48MP Sony IMX 972 (1/2.55", 0.7µm-1.4µm), f/2.2, 13mm, PDAF; 4K@60fps

Telephoto 4x: 48MP Sony IMX 973 (1/2.55", 0.7µm-1.4µm), f/2.8, 100mm, dual pixel PDAF, sensor-shift IS; 4K@60fps

Front camera: 18MP Sony IMX 914 (likely 1.0µm), f/1.9, 20mm, PDAF; 4K@60fps

iOS 26 simplifies the camera interface by bringing Photo and Video modes to the forefront, with other modes accessed by swiping left or right. You might think the other modes have disappeared, but if you swipe sideways from the active mode, they show up - perhaps not the most intuitive implementation.

You swipe up to reveal capture options like flash and exposure - another thing you don't have a visual clue for so you have to know it's there. The same menu is also accessed from an icon in the far corner, so the options are available to those who aren't familiar with Apple's ways. Some contextual indicators/buttons also show up there, like the auto Night mode crescent, and there's also an always featured flash toggle there in addition to it being present in the swipe-up menu - it's a bit of a mess, yes.

iPhone camera app on iOS 26 • Camera settings in Settings

The Camera Control dedicated capacitive touch area/button is present on all the models in the iPhone 17 series. In iOS 26, the feature has been simplified to be more intuitive (supposedly), and you can customize which camera settings appear in the control overlay by double-light pressing the control button and accessing "Customize" within the Camera Control settings. You can now choose your most frequently used options, such as exposure, depth, zoom, or camera switching, making the control button less overwhelming and more efficient.

In keeping with tradition, unfortunately, Apple's camera settings remain incredibly convoluted and disorganized. With the new camera UI redesign, you can at least quickly access a subset of the camera resolution controls, but not all of them - sorely missing is 12 MP/24 MP switching, which you still operate from the main settings. Most advanced options are still hidden away and utterly disorganized within the main settings menu.

Daylight photo quality

Main camera

The iPhone 17 Pro Max captures more or less the same photos with its main camera as the previous generation, and those are photos that are easy to like if you're an iPhone user, and now seemingly more universally so too.

Random textures may look a bit too digital, but there's plenty of detail and the 24 MP default mode looks good on a pixel level despite the 24 MP not being 'true' 24 MP. We're generally liking the colors too, which is not always the case with iPhones - there's a nice level of pop, and white balance is spot on. Dynamic range is excellent too, and we're looking at well-developed extremes and a great contrast at the same time.

Daylight samples, main camera (1x), 24MP

A quick side-by-side with the older generation (represented by the iPhone 16 Pro) shows that the new phone is a bit more expressive with colors and contrast and that's probably why we like its photos better.

Daylight comparison, main camera (1x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

We're not entirely thrilled with how the iPhone renders human subjects, though. There's a general softness with facial features that is looking like a deliberate decision to make more flattering portraits, but we're not really fans of such treatments. Also hard to miss is the iPhone's stubborn tendency to keep brightly-lit parts of a face from clipping, as much as it can, to a point where faces go needlessly warm and saturated with unrealistic colors.

Daylight samples, main camera (1x), Photo mode

Daylight samples, main camera (1x), Portrait mode

The 12 MP mode is a good idea if you want to save some storage space and it's also delivering great images. In practice, 12 MP is indeed plenty good enough for the vast majority of applications and use cases.

Daylight samples, main camera (1x), 12MP

At the other end of the spectrum is the 48 MP full-res mode. As before, Apple has one of the better implementations and these shots do actually offer better texture definition - given the right lighting, of course.

Daylight samples, main camera (1x), 48MP

Moving on to the 2x zoom level, we're not getting a 24 MP option, but the 12MP shots are pretty great. Detail is nice and sharp, even in foliage and other random textures, and global parameters remain top-notch.

Daylight samples, main camera (2x)

Indeed, the 17 Pro Max shows a meaningful improvement here over the already solid previous generation.

Daylight comparison, main camera (2x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

The 2x zoom level with its 48mm-equivalent focal length is better for general people shots than the 1x and the perspective gets nicer as does the shooting distance. The skin softening and questionable dynamic range and color choices remain, though.

Daylight samples, main camera (2x), Photo mode

Telephoto camera

Moving to the new telephoto, the 24 MP shots are good but they're certainly not pin sharp and have a heavily processed rendition of fine textures. There's nothing else to complain about, with colors and dynamic range being excellent.

Daylight samples, telephoto camera (4x), 24MP

You could make a case that the 12MP versions of the 4x scenes look a little better from up close, but while they do have a certain pixel-level sharpness advantage, detail doesn't look a whole lot more organic.

Daylight samples, telephoto camera (4x), 12MP

The 48 MP mode images are softish and somewhat grainy, but there could be an upside to shooting in full-res if you are doing your own post-processing.

Daylight samples, telephoto camera (4x), 48MP

Head-to-head comparisons against the iPhone 16 Pro don't help the new model's case too much. The 24 MP shots from the 17 Pro Max look softer at 1:1, and if you're to grab one of the 12 MP counterparts, they're about as good as those from the 16 Pro, not better.

Daylight comparison, telephoto camera: iPhone 17 Pro Max (4x) • iPhone 16 Pro (5x)

There's not much that's different in photos of people at 4x compared to 1x and 2x, other than the clear head-and-shoulders framing and perspective advantage of the 100mm focal length. There's still a fair bit of facial smoothening and highlight restoration that results in extra warm skin tones.

Daylight samples, telephoto camera (4x), Photo mode

8x zoom level shots are good without being overly exciting. Detail is alright, and the global properties remain excellent.

Daylight samples, telephoto camera (8x)

But the thing is, the iPhone 16 Pro isn't doing too bad at 8x either - its photos just might be that extra bit sharper, if a little bit grainier. So far, no real advantage coming from the new telephoto camera then.

Daylight comparison, telephoto camera (8x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

We'd have hoped to have seen an improvement in close focusing, but the roughly 85cm of minimum focusing distance on the 17 Pro Max's telephoto doesn't make it a viable option for closeups.

Closeups

So as a bit of a detour, the 2x zoom from the main camera is your best bet for closeups on the iPhone 17 Pro (Max). Even though Apple wants you to use the ultrawide camera zoomed in digitally to main camera field of view, we consider that approach impractical because of the short subject distance and the consequences of it (shadows, iffy perspective, disturbing the subject).

The 2x from the main camera, on the other hand, addresses all these aspects and returns very good results. Not 200MP telephoto closeup level of good results, but reasonably close, better than expected, and almost good enough to make you wonder how important that close-focusing tele is (but yes, it is, after all). Now if only Apple would stop pushing the silly ultrawide-based 'macro' mode.

Closeup samples, main camera (2x), Photo mode

Ultrawide camera

The ultrawide is pretty good for ultrawide purposes, be they interiors, expansive vistas, or just exaggerated perspectives. Saved at 24 MP, its photos have good sharpness in outdoor scenarios and more or less keep that in dimmer indoor conditions. Saturation is a notch below the other two cameras' output but not so much as to be dull, and white balance continues to be on point. Dynamic range is quite great as well.

Daylight samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), 24MP

Comparisons against the previous generation reveal little improvement - you could argue that having the 24 MP shots on the iPhone 17 Pro Max is an advantage all in itself, but we can't spot a meaningful detail improvement, and if you use the new model's 12 MP shots below, you'll see they're about the same as those from the old one.

Daylight comparison, ultrawide camera (0.5x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

Indeed, the 12 MP images from the 17 Pro Max's ultrawide camera are essentially the same in terms of detail rendition as those from last year's model.

Daylight samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), 12MP

Here's how some of those scenes look when saved at the nominal resolution.

Daylight samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), 48MP

Selfies

Setting aside the coolness of being able to take landscape selfies with a phone held in portrait (and the actual usefulness of it), front camera photos from the iPhone 17 Pro are not much different from previous generations. Detail is very good and the autofocus means you can do goofy closeups. There can be a bit of that heavy handed highlight restoration and excessive skin tone warming in certain lighting, but overall faces are looking good.

Selfie samples

It's worth pointing out that the new model's 18 MP shots come out noticeably wider than on the previous generation - it's a 20mm vs. 23mm equivalent focal length. That could very well be beneficial in itself, if you want to capture larger groups of people or more of your surroundings.

Selfie comparison: iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

Low-light photo quality

Main camera

In the dark, the iPhone 17 Pro Max wasn't too keen to engage its auto Night mode in all but a handful of camera/scene combinations. That means you can get 24 MP low-light shots in pretty much all sorts of conditions, unless you specifically opt for the 12 MP mode.

Main camera shots are excellent. They're packed with detail and the grain that goes with it in the shadows isn't half bad. Dynamic range is nicely wide, though the iPhone does like to maintain a bit of highlight clipping with some point light sources - it doesn't hurt. The auto white balance was consistently accurate and color rendition is overall top-notch.

Low-light samples, main camera (1x), 24MP

Here's how the above scenes look when shot at 12 MP, plus an extra scene where the phone wouldn't give us a 24 MP shot in full auto.

Low-light samples, main camera (1x), 12MP

There's not a whole lot of differences between the new and the old model at 1x.

Low-light comparison, main camera (1x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

At 2x, the 17 Pro Max does a remarkable job, capturing fine detail like it's got a dedicated camera at 50mm (and a good one at that).

Low-light samples, main camera (2x)

This is also one of the more easily noticeable improvements over the previous generation.

Low-light comparison, main camera (2x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

Telephoto camera

The 4x zoom results aren't our favorite - they are on the soft side and are pretty grainy, whether you're shooting in 24 MP or 12 MP. On the other hand, dynamic range is very good, and white balance and saturation are typically spot on (that fourth sample is an outlier).

Low-light samples, telephoto camera (4x), 24MP

Here's how these scenes would look in 12 MP, plus a couple extra ones without a 24 MP counterpart.

Low-light samples, telephoto camera (4x), 12MP

We were really rooting for the 17 Pro Max against the old model in the low-light telephoto comparison, but we can't say there's much of an improvement - in fact, the 16 Pro might just be a little bit better. But really, it's a toss-up.

Low-light comparison, telephoto camera: iPhone 17 Pro Max (4x) • iPhone 16 Pro (5x)

Zooming in further, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's shots get softer and noisier. It's not that they're unusable, but they're certainly not particularly impressive from a detail standpoint. Global properties remain great, though.

Low-light samples, telephoto camera (8x)

Neither generation is actually looking too hot at 8x, but they're so similar that one inevitably wonders where the upgrade is.

Low-light comparison, telephoto camera (8x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

Ultrawide camera

The ultrawide camera's exposures can look a little gloomy (it was, admittedly, a new moon on the night we shot these samples). The photos are also on the soft and grainy side, but we'd still say they're okay for this type of camera (like it or not, ultrawides are often overlooked, even on ultimate high-end phones).

Low-light samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), 24MP

The 12 MP variants are also soft, so it's not like you'd be gaining a lot of pixel-level benefits by shooting in this mode.

Low-light samples, ultrawide camera (0.5x), 12MP

We're also not seeing a generational improvement on this camera - the 16 Pro is as good (or rather, as average) as the 17 Pro Max.

Low-light comparison, ultrawide camera (0.5x): iPhone 17 Pro Max • iPhone 16 Pro

Video recording

The iPhone 17 Pro Max can record video up to 4K at either 60, 30, or 24fps with all of its cameras (the three rear ones, and the front-facing one). The primary camera on the back can also do 4K120, at both 1x and 2x zoom. On our retail European units we also had PAL modes (25fps and 100fps). You get Dolby Vision recording capability in all modes too, plus ProRes and Apple Log 2 options, though you will need to record to external storage for some of the higher fps modes to be able to work.

If you want to capture 4K60 or higher, you must do so in the 'high-efficiency' HEVC/h.265 format, while for lesser modes you can choose between that and the AVC/h.264 option.

As before, the iPhone can be set to record Spatial Audio, in which case it will embed two audio tracks - stereo AAC for backwards compatibility and four-channel APAC. Simple stereo and mono options are also available.

Stabilization is always on in all modes (including 4K120) - you can't turn it off if you have other means of ensuring stable footage.

You can check out the playlist below, which includes multiple video samples.

iPhones tend to set the standard for video quality and that holds true of the 17 Pro Max this year as well. For one, there's no discernible difference between 24fps, 30fps, and 60fps footage from any of the three rear cameras and that also applies to the 2x and 8x zoom levels. Detail is excellent at all native zoom levels and very good at the 'made-up' ones. Contrast is great, dynamic range is nice and wide, colors are pleasantly vibrant.

At night, we get to observe a long-standing problem of Apple camera lenses - internal reflections caused by lights pointing into the phone. These are visible at 1x if you go looking for them and are more obvious at 2x from the main camera, and there's more of them from the telephoto's tetraprism at 4x and 8x. At least the ultrawide doesn't get them. That aside, the main camera footage at 1x is excellent, with wide dynamic range, excellent color, and sharp detail. The ultrawide and the telephoto also deliver very good footage, the 2x is alright and the 8x results are more into usable territory.

Competition

The new iPhone 17 Pro Max is a complicated phone to sum up. It is the best iPhone ever. And for that it will become the best-seller Apple hoped it to be. That is a fact.

But we are not sure if it's the easiest to love iPhone. It brought a new design that immediately stirred controversy and it seems that it did not bring some the promised improvements. The camera quality hasn't drastically changed as we hoped, the screen isn't quite as bright as promised, and while the performance jump is there, the new cooling system isn't all that impressive.

The iPhone Air is the first alternative to those who really want a different iPhone this year instead of incremental upgrades and a polarizing design.

You should also consider the iPhone 17, which now has a 120Hz display, similar performance and camera options that range from 0.5x to 2x. It is a compact and light-weight phone with huge potential.

Finally, the previous, better crafted iPhone Pro Max models will remain valued by those looking for premium designs, until they finally disappear from store shelves.

Few iPhone fans will consider Android flagship, though maybe they should. Smartphones like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, the S-Pen enabled Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the OG Android Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, or innovative offers like the Honor Magic V5 - will often make this iPhone look and feel behind the curve.

Verdict

The iPhone 17 Pro Max makes a controversial switch to aluminum, which helped keep the weight in check and perhaps maintains adequate sustained performance, but it also hurt the durability by making the iPhone more prone to scratches. Then there is the mix of glass and metal on the back, which combined with the new color options, make this iPhone one of the less likable in recent memory.

The display of the 17 Pro Max gained cool new anti-glare finish, but its cutout is still the same unsightly mess. It is a great screen, yes, but we have already seen it a couple of times already.

We do appreciate the improved battery life and charging speeds, even if it requires the new charger with absurd name and its AVS charging protocol.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max brought some improvements for selfie and zoom photography and those will be universally appreciated. But the upgrade isn't as huge as the keynote had us believe and it's behind the curve in 2025. Yes, the images are very good to great, but the phone has the hardware, the processing power and the entire Apple hivemind, and it still lags behind the Chinese Ultra phones.

What the iPhone 17 Pro Max does amazing is videos - no matter the camera, the conditions, the chosen format - the iPhone 17 Pro Max will ace the scene. Once again Apple deserves praise for making a camera app that's suitable both for mainstream and pro users, something no one else in the industry can quite pull off.

The iPhone 17 Pro Max may be the most capable iPhone ever, but it's not looking like it will go down in history as the best loved one. Its mixed bag design, the lack of obvious improvements, and the unpolished state of iOS 26 right now, make up for a phone that millions will buy, but far fewer will be truly excited about. With the design taking a questionable direction and iOS falling behind the feature curve the improved battery and new zoom camera face the unenviable task of carrying the entire expensive package. We are hoping Apple is quick to at least add some polish to the Liquid Glass ordeal as case makers take care of the other issue.
