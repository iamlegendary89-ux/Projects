IntroThe new Google Pixel 9a is here, and it bolsters the ranks of the Pixel 9 series beautifully. Google's new value proposition is easily the most complete one yet, with a friendly new design, the largest battery ever fitted on a Pixel phone, a promising camera setup, a brighter and larger screen, a flagship-grade chip, and most importantly, the same unchanged $499 price tag. Wow, that's a pretty impressive list of improvements over the older Pixel 8a, especially considering that the pricing has remained intact.Should the Pixel 9 start feeling a little uneasy due to the mounting in-house competition? Well, that seems to be the case: the Pixel 9a might just steal all its thunder!

Google has graced the Pixel 9a with a pretty substantial redesign. Gone are the slightly curved design elements of the Pixel 8a, we now get a flat and right-angled Pixel 9a, which employs more or less the same design language as the Pixel 9 series itself. That could potentially hurt the ergonomics of the Pixel 9a a little. The camera island at the back has also been redesigned, with the side-to-side 3D Visor of old gone. In its place, we get a nearly flush camera, which doesn't protrude at all––that's great to see! This brings us back to simpler times, when cameras didn't stick out weirdly from the back of phones.Another major change is in the size department: we get a larger 6.3-inch screen (versus a 6.1-inch one on the Pixel 8a). This makes the Pixel 9a just as well-spec'd as the Pixel 9. This screen size upgrade comes along with a size increase as well.

The new Pixel 9a measures 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm in size, so it's slightly taller, wider, and thicker than the Pixel 9, which stands at 152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm. That's okay: a more premium and compact design is the Pixel 9's forte. Finally, the Pixel 9a weighs 186gr, slightly less than the Pixel 9's 198gr. A pretty significant difference between the premium and affordable Pixels are the materials used: the Pixel 9 employs an aluminum frame with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 glass at the front and back, whereas the Pixel 9a only uses aluminum for the frame, but has a plastic back; at the front, we get Gorilla Glass 3. Another round which the Pixel 9 seemingly wins, but does this even matter?Receive the latest Google newsSubscribe

For all intents and purposes, the Pixel 9 has "donated" its display to the Pixel 9a. We get the same 6.3-inch Actua FHD+ OLED panel with 60/120 refresh rate and familiar 20:9 aspect ratio. Such 60/120Hz displays are not as smooth as more premium ones that go down to 10 or even 1Hz and deliver a smoother viewing experience, but that's still not a big issue here. Anything is better than the iPhone 16's 60Hz, that's for sure.Another important aspect that's similar between the two phones is the peak brightness. We measure both at above 2,500 nits, which is superb and means either will be very legible in whatever lighting conditions.Our tests also reveal that there are no other significant differences between the two screens, so you're getting basically the same experience regardless of which one you pick. Display Measurements:

Color gamutColor accuracyGrayscale accuracyThe CIE 1931 xy color gamut chart represents the set(area)of colors that a display can reproduce,with the sRGB colorspace(the highlighted triangle)serving as reference.The chart also provides a visual representation of a display's color accuracy. The small squares across the boundaries of the triangle are the reference points for the various colors, while the small dots are the actual measurements. Ideally, each dot should be positioned on top of its respective square. The 'x:CIE31' and 'y:CIE31' values in the table below the chart indicate the position of each measurement on the chart. 'Y' shows the luminance (in nits) of each measured color, while 'Target Y' is the desired luminance level for that color. Finally, 'ΔE 2000' is the Delta E value of the measured color. Delta E values of below 2 are ideal.These measurements are made using Portrait Displays' CalMAN calibration software.Google Pixel 9Google Pixel 9aThe Color accuracy chart gives an idea of how close a display's measured colors are to their referential values.

allThe Pixel 9 has an in-display fingerprint scanner, and so does the Pixel 9a. We are thrilled to test if there are any significant differences in accuracy and speed of use.Performance and Software Same chip, possibly similar performanceAs it is now tradition, Google has graced the Pixel 9a with the Tensor G4 chipset, the same flagship-grade chipset that clicks and ticks in just about every other Pixel 9 device out there. This is great because it gives you the flagship processor in a device that's significantly more affordable. The Tensor G4 is manufactured on a 4nm process, making it competitive with most current flagship chips. It’s mostly tuned for AI and machine learning rather than excelling in synthetic benchmarks, but handles real-world tasks effortlessly, so you'll most certainly be just enough for regular tasks, especially at the unbeatable price tag of $499.CPU Performance Benchmarks:Geekbench 6SingleHigher is betterGoogle Pixel 91800Google Pixel 9a1687Geekbench 6MultiHigher is betterGoogle Pixel 94573Google Pixel 9a4385View allIn our synthetic benchmark tests, the Pixel 9 takes a slight lead, but nothing too significant.

The Pixel 9 will be the first one to throttle when heavy gaming is involved.Recommended StoriesMemory-wise, the Pixel 9a arrives with 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of on-board storage, which is a decent memory configuration. The more premium Pixel 9 arrives with 12GB of RAM, giving you more headroom for app juggling and on-device AI processing. The storage configurations here are similar: 128GB and 256GB. Android 15 is the software of choice on both phones. The full roster of Gemini AI features is supported on both devices.Both devices will enjoy Google's seven-year software support policy, with the Pixel 9 being supported until 2031 and the new Pixel 9a until 2032. CameraNew camera and no camera bump

Boasting a camera flush with the back is notable in itself, but the Pixel 9a has also scored some notable changes here as well. It boasts a 48MP camera with an F1.7 aperture, a 1/2.0" sensor, 0.8µm pixels, dual-pixel autofocus and OIS. If specs are considered, it's the same camera as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. There's also a 13MP ultrawide camera.This is a very decent camera setup; we definitely loved the main camera of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which delivered very realistic colors, balanced dynamics (though it struggled with the highlights in some scenes), and an overall pretty decent camera performance.Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 comes with 50MP main and new 48MP ultrawide cameras, which is decidedly a more flagship camera setup. The Pixel 9 fared significantly better in the PhoneArena Camera Score test, outpacing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in both still photos and video-recording, so we expect the same to transpire with the Pixel 9a and Pixel 9, too.PhoneArena Camera Score:

In our custom camera test, the Pixel 9a performs very well, but loses to the Pixel 9 a bit. The main reasons are the significantly stronger main camera performance of the Pixel 9 in both photos and videos. That was expected and totally normal. Still, let us reiterate: the Pixel 9a does a very fine job.Image Quality

The Pixel 9a arrives with a 5,100mAh battery on deck––that's the largest one ever fitted on a Pixel phone. This, paired with the fast and efficient Tensor G4, easily propels the Pixel 9a to the very top of the Pixel battery life charts!In our custom battery tests, the Pixel 9a totally dominates the Pixel 9, achieving nearly 20 hours in the custom web browsing test, nearly 11 hours in our custom video test, and 12 hours and a half in the 3D gaming exercise, all of which make it one of the longest-lasting Pixel phones we've ever seen. Superb!That said, the Pixel 9 fared well in our custom battery tests (17 hours 34 minutes in our web browsing test, 8 hours and a half in our video streaming test, and 10 hours in our gaming test), so we have extremely high hopes for the Pixel 9a, but ultimately, that was significantly lower than what the Pixel 9a offers.PhoneArena Battery and Charging Test Results:

One area in which the Pixel 9a will lag a little are the charging speeds, though. We got a slight upgrade to 23W wired charging speeds (up from 18W on the Pixel 8a), while wireless charging remains 7.5W. That's not great, but par for the course for a $499 phone. The Pixel 9, on the other hand, boasts 27W wired and 15W wireless charging. It takes an hour and 40 minutes to bring the Pixel 9 from 0 to 100%, but a brief 30-minute charging session delivers a 51% charge. As it has a smaller battery, it will certainly charge faster. Also read:Google Pixel 9a batteryAudio Quality and hapticsThe Pixel 9 delivers slightly better audio quality with slightly less distortion at higher volumes, but the Pixel 9a isn't significantly worse in comparison.The same applies to the haptic feedback as well: both devices deliver similar strong and precise vibration feedback that makes typing on the keyboard and interacting with the interface pleasing. Specs ComparisonHere's an essential Pixel 9a vs Pixel 9 specs comparison:Google Pixel 9aGoogle Pixel 9Size, weight154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mm186gr152.8 x 72.0 x 8.5mm198grScreen6.3" Actua FHD+ OLED60/120HzGorilla Glass 32,700-nit peak brightness6.3" Actua FHD+ OLED60/120HzGorilla Glass Victus 22,700-nit peak brightnessProcessorTensor G4, 4nmTensor G4, 4nmRAM, Storage8GB/128GB8GB/256GB12GB/128GB12GB/256GBCameras48MP main13MP ultrawide13MP front50MP main, f/1.68, 1/1.31" sensor48MP ultra, f/1.7, 1/1.25" sensor10.5MP frontBattery5,100mAh4,700mAhChargingUSB-C23W wired7.5W wirelessUSB-C27W wired15W wirelessAlso read: Google Pixel 9a preview: the best candidate for your $500?Summary

Wow, what a great value the Pixel 9a is!At $499, it might very well be the smash-hit success story on the affordable phone market this year. We notice that while the overall experience is very similar to the Pixel 9, the battery life alone might definitely push you in the hands of the newer affordable trooper. While the Pixel 9 costs $799, you don't get much extra in comparison with the affordable phone: a more premium design language and better camera image quality are the two major differentiating factors here. That's great value, and the Pixel 9a nails all the essential pillars of a great smartphone but aces the battery life one, which is crucial. Yes, it's formulaic and a little bit boring, but it offers the best bang of the buck right now, especially for Pixel lovers.
