The search giant didn't really introduce any massive changes to the formula this year, but there are still changes to consider.The design has been updated and is now flatter and more in line with the other Pixel 9 devices. The display has grown a bit since last year and is now 6.3 inches instead of 6.1. It is brighter as well. All the while, the device's overall footprint hasn't changed much, and neither its thickness nor weight has been affected. The latter point is particularly impressive since the Pixel 9a has the biggest battery out of any pixel to date at 5,100 mAh.Google Pixel 9a specs at a glance:Body: 154.7x73.3x8.9mm, 186g; Glass front (Gorilla Glass), aluminum frame, plastic back; IP68 dust-tight and water resistant (immersible up to 1.5m for 30 min).

That brings about some other niceties, like a dual-band GPS. Also likely related is the upgraded battery charging rate of 23W.In keeping with tradition, the Pixel 9a offers the core Pixel experience, including a computational camera and various tools, AI and otherwise, on a budget. At current pricing, the regular Pixel 9 is admittedly a bit close, but that doesn't necessarily mean the Pixel 9a is bad value. Read along as we dig into the matter further.UnboxingThe Pixel 9a ships in a cardboard two-piece box with a cardboard sleeve on top that is printed in a color matching your unit. That's a smart cost-cutting measure right there. The box itself isn't the toughest and hardest we've seen, but it should still protect the phone just fine in shipping. Plus, we appreciate that it is eco-friendly, with zero plastic in and out.Unsurprisingly, you don't get much in the way of accessories. The Pixel 9a just ships with a single USB Type-C to Type-C cable. No charger and no additional accessories are present.
