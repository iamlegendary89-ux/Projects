Verdict: The Phone (3) is a flagship only in Nothing'sWith the Phone (3), Nothing remains true to its philosophy of developing smartphones that are a little different from the competition. This is evident in the transparent back, the asymmetrical arrangement of the cameras, the slim and fast Nothing OS 3.5, and extras such as the Glyph Matrix with its 486 LEDs.With five years of OS updates and software support until 2032, the Nothing Phone (3) provides further reasons for consideration. Other plus points include the bright AMOLED screen, the good camera system, and the large and fast-charging battery, which should last a whole day of intensive use.

That being said, the Nothing Phone (3) also has some minor weaknesses. The Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 is fast but doesn't quite match the €799 asking price purchase price for the base variant.Additionally, you don't get an LTPO AMOLED but only an LPTS display. Nothing also cuts corners on the display glass. While many similarly priced smartphones rely on Gorilla Glass Victus, the Nothing Phone (3) only features the less resistant Gorilla Glass 7i.

Build: Glyph Matrix replaces the Glyph interfaceWith its 1.86 mm thin display frame, the Nothing Phone (3), which is available in black and white, makes a high-quality visual impression. There is also nothing to complain about in terms of workmanship. However, the phone does make a subtle crackling noise when twisted.The biggest innovation compared to its predecessor is on the transparent back. The iconic Nothing design is still there, but the Glyph interface has been replaced by the Glyph Matrix — a small monochrome display with 489 LEDs.The Glyph Matrix is located in the top right-hand corner and shows, for example, the battery level or provides information about incoming messages. The displays (aka Glyph Toys) can be switched via a white button underneath. The red LED signals ongoing audio and video recordings by flashing.

Software: Android updates until 2032 and an SDK for the Glyph MatrixThe Nothing Phone (3) runs Nothing OS 3.5, which is based on Android 15. Nothing promises five years of OS upgrades up to Android 20. Android security updates will be available every 2 months for seven years.Nothing OS 3.5 extends the standard Android interface with an independent design and the Essential Space — an AI hub that helps users with everyday tasks.Essential Space receives its input from the user. If you press the Essential button, it takes a screenshot or takes the image from the camera app along with an optional note. The button can also be used to start audio recordings.Captured information is automatically transcribed and added to the AI hub. This can be called up and browsed by pressing the button twice.With the Glyph Matrix, users do not have to make do with the ready-made Glyph Toys. Interested users can join the Nothing developer programs on GitHub, download the SDK, and develop their own Glyph Toys.

It delivers good voice quality during calls and also suppresses ambient noise efficiently.Camera: 50 MP in a pack of fourRecording with the selfie cameraThe main, ultra-wide-angle, and telephoto cameras of the Nothing Phone (3) each have a resolution of 50 MP.The selfie camera also has a 50 MP sensor, which allows the smartphone to take appealing portraits and deliver very usable quality for video chats. Videos can be recorded with all lenses in good quality at a maximum of 4K 60 fps.In daylight, the main camera equipped with a fast 1/1.3-inch sensor takes beautiful photos that impress with their high dynamic range and realistic colors but sometimes appear blurred. In low light, the large sensor manages to capture many details.The ultra-wide-angle camera does a good job, but its photos are quite washed out at the edges. The telephoto camera also takes on the task of a macro lens and achieves good image quality if you limit yourself to the 3x optical zoom. The digital zoom works up to 60x, but subjects already become blurred at 5x magnification.

Screen Flickering / PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation)ℹTo dim the screen, some notebooks will simply cycle the backlight on and off in rapid succession - a method called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) . This cycling frequency should ideally be undetectable to the human eye. If said frequency is too low, users with sensitive eyes may experience strain or headaches or even notice the flickering altogether.Screen flickering / PWM detected 90 HzAmplitude: 12.96 %Secondary Frequency: 1086 HzThe display backlight flickers at 90 Hz (worst case, e.g., utilizing PWM) . The frequency of 90 Hz is very low, so the flickering may cause eyestrain and headaches after extended use.In comparison: 53 % of all tested devices do not use PWM to dim the display. If PWM was detected, an average of 8228 (minimum: 5 - maximum: 343500) Hz was measured.

Gaming: Smooth gameplay guaranteedWith the Adreno 825-GPU of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 the smartphone runs current games smoothly. This is also shown by the fps measurements with the Gamebench tool.The smartphone achieves maximum frame rates in all graphics settings and is only slowed down by the games' internal fps limits.In PUBG Mobile, however, attaining 120 fps is possible at the lowest detail level.Genshin Impact

Emissions: Hot Nothing smartphoneSurface temperaturesThe Nothing Phone (3) can get very warm under load. In the stress test with Burnout Benchmark, we measured surface temperatures of up to 52.1 °C. You won't want to touch the smartphone under this kind of load.The 3DMark stress tests show that the smartphone quickly throttles the SoC performance under load — to less than 60% of the initial performance in the worst case.

Editor of the original article: Manuel Masiero - Senior Tech Writer - 348 articles published on Notebookcheck since 2012My fascination for computers started with the C64. Since then, I’ve put everything that comes my way in terms of hardware through its paces. From the C64 to the Amiga 500 and the first PC with an 8088 CPU, my list of projects has grown increasingly longer. For more than 20 years now I have also turned my hobby into my profession and have been active in the mobile section of Notebookcheck since 2021. Before that, I worked as a hardware editor for IDG Media (tecChannel.de) and VNU Business Publications (PC professional), among others.Translator: Ninh Ngoc Duy - Editorial Assistant - 627884 articles published on Notebookcheck since 2008My main responsibility as an editorial assistant is maintaining the Library section, which aggregates reviews from other publications and channels. In addition, my daily breakfast is Notebookcheck's long list of new content, which I comb through to select the most interesting topics for translation from English to French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch."contact me via:
