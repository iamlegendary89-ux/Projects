    "onePageSummary": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 offers a compact flagship experience with top-tier performance thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, but iterative updates leave some areas wanting. Its 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display peaks at 2600 nits (measured 1395 nits by GSMArena) with excellent color accuracy but suffers from 240Hz PWM dimming affecting eye comfort. Camera hardware remains unchanged since the S22, resulting in solid but unremarkable photo quality—low-light and telephoto performance are weak points noted by GSMArena and PhoneArena. Battery life is decent (13h active use) despite the 4000mAh capacity, though 25W charging feels outdated compared to rivals. Software shines with One UI 7 and 7-year updates, while the lightweight design (162g) and IP68 rating impress. However, omissions like UWB and Qi2 magnets frustrate power users.",
    "pros": [
      "Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with leading benchmarks (mentioned: GSMArena, NotebookCheck)",
      "Compact lightweight design ideal for one-handed use (mentioned: GSMArena, AndroidCentral)",
      "Bright AMOLED display with excellent color accuracy (mentioned: DXOMark, TomsGuide)",
      "Long-term software support with 7 Android updates (mentioned: NotebookCheck, TechRadar)",
      "Improved AI features including on-device processing (mentioned: AndroidCentral, TomsGuide)"

    "cons": [
      "Slow 25W wired charging speeds unchanged for years (mentioned: GSMArena, PhoneArena)",
      "Camera hardware identical to S24/S23 generations (mentioned: NotebookCheck, TechRadar)",
      "No UWB support or Qi2 magnets without a case (mentioned: AndroidCentral, NotebookCheck)",
      "PWM dimming at only 240Hz affects eye comfort (mentioned: NotebookCheck, GSMArena)",
      "Base storage still starts at 128GB UFS 3.1 (mentioned: GSMArena, PhoneArena)"
