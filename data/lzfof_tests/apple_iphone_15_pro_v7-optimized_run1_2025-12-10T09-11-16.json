    "summary_1_page": "The Apple iPhone 15 Pro combines premium design with cutting-edge performance. Its titanium frame reduces weight to 187g while maintaining durability (GSMArena, TechRadar). The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display offers 120Hz ProMotion, 2000 nits HBM brightness, and thinner bezels (PhoneArena, NotebookCheck). Powered by the 3nm A17 Pro chip, it delivers class-leading CPU/GPU performance but faces thermal throttling under sustained loads (NotebookCheck, Android Authority). The triple-camera system features a 48MP main sensor with 24MP default output, improved stabilization, and ProRes video recording, though it lacks the Pro Max's 5x telephoto (DxOMark, TomsGuide). Battery life averages 12-13 hours of active use with slow 20W charging criticized by multiple sources (GSMArena, PhoneArena). Key upgrades include USB-C with 10Gbps data transfer, customizable Action Button replacing the mute switch, and iOS 17 with features like StandBy mode. While software support isn't formally guaranteed for 7 years, Apple's update history suggests 5-6 years of updates (Android Authority, TechRadar).",
