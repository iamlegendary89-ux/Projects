    "summary_1_page": "The iPhone 15 Pro is a refined evolution of Apple's flagship, delivering meaningful upgrades like a lighter titanium frame, USB-C, and the powerful A17 Pro chip. Real-world testing shows it excels in display quality (up to 2000 nits brightness) and camera versatility, especially in portraits and video (DXOMark 154 camera score). However, GSMArena and NotebookCheck note sustained performance throttling during gaming, and charging remains slow at 20W (90 mins to full). While the Action Button adds customization, iOS still lacks Android's flexibility. At $999 for 128GB, it's a premium package with minor compromises - great for Apple loyalists, but Android alternatives offer better value in some areas.",
