    "summary_1_page": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 delivers flagship performance with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, praised by all 8 sources for its speed (Geekbench 10050, AnTuTu 2.19M). It maintains a compact 162g titanium-frame design with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and IP68 rating. The 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display hits 2600 nits peak (1395 nits measured) but uses 240Hz PWM dimming. Camera hardware remains unchanged since S22, with DXOMark awarding the display 157 points. Battery life sees modest gains (13-15h active use), while 25W charging is universally criticized. One UI 7 and 7-year software support are highlights, though AI features feel underdeveloped.",
