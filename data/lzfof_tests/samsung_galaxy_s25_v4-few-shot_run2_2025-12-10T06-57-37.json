    "summary_1_page": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 delivers flagship performance with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip across all global markets, praised by all 8 sources for its 40% CPU/30% GPU gains over predecessors. While retaining the same camera hardware since S22 (50MP main, 10MP 3x telephoto, 12MP ultrawide), computational photography improvements via Galaxy AI receive mixed reviews. The 6.2-inch 120Hz AMOLED display hits 2600 nits peak but lacks anti-reflective coating. Battery life shows modest gains (13-15h active use) despite unchanged 4000mAh capacity, with 25W wired charging universally criticized as outdated. New AI features like Now Bar and Gemini integration impress, though some note redundancy with Bixby.",
