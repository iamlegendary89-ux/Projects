    "summary_1_page": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 stands out as a compact flagship with significant performance gains from the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, delivering top-tier benchmarks (AnTuTu 2.19M, GeekBench 10,050). Its 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display offers 2600 nits peak brightness and 120Hz refresh rate, though PWM dimming at 240Hz may affect eye comfort. Camera hardware remains unchanged since the S22, resulting in competent but dated imaging performance. Battery life is solid (13.15h active use) despite a 4000mAh capacity, but 25W charging feels slow. One UI 7 and 7-year software support enhance longevity, while AI features like Galaxy AI and Gemini integration add smart functionality. Design refinements include a lighter 162g build and IP68 rating. However, omissions like UWB and Qi2 magnets (without a case) limit ecosystem integration. Competitors offer better cameras and faster charging, but the S25's compact form and sustained performance make it a strong choice for small-phone enthusiasts.",
