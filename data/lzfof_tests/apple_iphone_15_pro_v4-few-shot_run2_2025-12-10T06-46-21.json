    "summary_1_page": "The iPhone 15 Pro transitions to a titanium frame, reducing weight by 19g while maintaining durability. All 9 sources highlight the A17 Pro chip's leading performance, with sustained gaming noted by GSMArena and NotebookCheck. The 48MP main camera receives universal acclaim, scoring 154 on DXOMark, though low-light performance trails some rivals. Battery life sees modest gains (10%) with 14.5h active use, but 20W charging remains a consistent criticism. USB-C adoption is welcomed but limited to USB 2.0 speeds on base models. iOS 17 features are praised, though Android-first features like RCS are noted as overdue.",
