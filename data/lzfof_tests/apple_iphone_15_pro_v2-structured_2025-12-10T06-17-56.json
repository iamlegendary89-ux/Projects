    "summary_1_page": "The Apple iPhone 15 Pro combines premium design with top-tier performance. Its titanium frame reduces weight by 19g compared to its predecessor, enhancing comfort while maintaining durability. The switch to USB-C enables faster data transfers and universal charging compatibility. The new Action Button replaces the mute switch, offering customizable shortcuts. Powered by the A17 Pro chip, it delivers class-leading performance, excelling in gaming and multitasking. The 6.1-inch OLED display boasts 2000 nits peak brightness and 120Hz ProMotion. Camera improvements include 24MP default shots, enhanced low-light performance, and ProRes video recording, though the 3x telephoto lags behind the Pro Max's 5x zoom. Battery life is adequate (12-13h active use) but charging remains slow at 20W. Software support is strong with iOS 17, though Android rivals now offer longer update commitments. Criticisms include initial overheating issues (partially resolved via update), high price, and limited storage options.",
