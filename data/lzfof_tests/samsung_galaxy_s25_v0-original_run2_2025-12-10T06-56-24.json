    "summary_1_page": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 is a compact flagship offering top-tier performance with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB RAM, and a bright 120Hz AMOLED display. It excels in AI capabilities and software longevity with 7 years of updates. However, it reuses the same camera hardware since the S22, resulting in mediocre low-light performance and lackluster upgrades. Battery life is solid at 13.15h active use, but 25W charging lags behind competitors. The design is lightweight and durable with IP68 rating, yet lacks UWB and Gorilla Armor glass. Priced at $799, it's a strong choice for compact phone enthusiasts but falls short in camera innovation and charging speed.",
