    "summary_1_page": "The Apple iPhone 15 Pro impresses with its titanium design, reducing weight while maintaining premium build quality. The transition to USB-C enhances connectivity, though charging speeds remain limited to 20W. Performance is top-tier with the A17 Pro chip, though throttling occurs under sustained loads. The camera system excels in video and main sensor performance, but low-light and telephoto capabilities lag behind competitors like the Pixel 8 Pro. Battery life is adequate for daily use, lasting around 12-13 hours, but fast charging is absent. Software's iOS 17 offers polished software with excellent support, though customization is limited. Priced starting at $999, it's a solid choice for iOS enthusiasts seeking compact flagship performance.",
