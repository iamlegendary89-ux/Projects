    "summary_1_page": "The iPhone 15 Pro receives widespread praise for its premium titanium design reducing weight (187g) while maintaining durability, with all reviewers highlighting the welcome addition of USB-C replacing Lightning (Android Authority, GSMArena, PhoneArena). Performance is exceptional thanks to the 3nm A17 Pro chip, achieving Geekbench multi-core scores around 7200, though some thermal throttling occurs under sustained loads (NotebookCheck, TechRadar). The camera system excels in daylight and video with DXOMark's 154 score, particularly praised for portrait modes and 24MP default shots, though low-light performance and ultrawide quality draw criticism (DXOMark, Android Central). Battery life averages 12-13 hours of active use (GSMArena), but 20W charging is considered slow versus competitors. iOS 17 offers polished software with 5+ years of updates, though customization remains limited versus Android. Key drawbacks include the high starting price ($999), limited 128GB base storage, and Pro Max-exclusive 5x telephoto creating segmentation (Tom's Guide, TechRadar).",
